[{"article": "John Jeffries, a 49-year-old money manager in Dover, Mass., had hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008 and is now coaching his son's basketball team and long-distance cycling.\n\nAlex Douglas, a Wall Street software architect, had both knees replaced last year at 39 after years of sports injuries. He can't wait to go kite-boarding this weekend. \"I've been cleared to have fun,\" he says.\n\nHard charging baby boomers and Generation X-ers are wearing out their joints at younger ages and turning to joint replacement surgery - but is it a quick fix? WSJ's health columnist Melinda Beck discusses with Kelsey Hubbard.\n\nJoint-replacement patients these days are younger and more active than ever before. More than half of all hip-replacement surgeries performed this year are expected to be on people under 65, with the same percentage projected for knee replacements by 2016. The fastest-growing group is patients 46 to 64, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery.\n\nMany active middle-agers are wearing out their joints with marathons, triathlons, basketball and tennis and suffering osteoarthritis years earlier than previous generations. They're also determined to stay active for many more years and not let pain or disability make them sedentary.\n\nTo accommodate them, implant makers are working to build joints with longer-wearing materials, and surgeons are offering more options like partial knee replacements, hip resurfacing and minimally invasive procedures.\n\nMore younger people also need joint-replacement surgery due to obesity, and some orthopedists refer them for weight-loss surgery first to reduce complications later.\n\nEven the most fit patients face a long period of rehabilitation after surgery and may not be able to resume high-impact activities.\n\n\"There is, to be honest, some irrational exuberance out there,\" says Daniel Berry, chief of orthopedic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. \"People may be overly optimistic about what joint replacement can do for them.\"\n\nOne big unknown: How long will the replacement joints last? In the past, many doctors assumed implants would wear out in about 10 or 15 years, and they urged young patients to put off surgery as long as possible to minimize the risk of needing a costly and difficult revision surgery\u2014or even two. (A total knee replacement typically costs $15,000 to $22,000. A revision can be $45,000 or more, with a higher risk of complications.)\n\nSteven Haas, chief of the knee service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, says he frequently sees young patients who are in too much pain to play with their kids, take walks, work or enjoy traveling. \"To them, the idea of being miserable in their 50s so they might not need another surgery in their 70s doesn't make much sense,\" he says.\n\nSeveral studies of hips and knees implanted in patients long ago have found that 85% to 90% are still functioning well after 20 years. Advances in wear-resistant materials may make implants being used today last even longer.\n\nFor example, many hips and knees use a combination of metal and polyethylene parts, and continuous motion can wear away small polyethylene particles. Scientists have found that irradiating the polyethylene removes free oxygen radicals that contribute to degradation, so the polyethylene components are expected to wear much longer.\n\n\"Metal-on-metal\" hip parts were supposed to wear better than plastic, but their use is declining due to concerns that they can release metal ions into patients' bloodstreams and cause soft-tissue damage. Hip implants made with \"ceramic-on-ceramic\" components have a disconcerting tendency to squeak.\n\nLast year, one manufacturer, Smith & Nephew , won clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market its latest technology as a \"30-year knee\" based on tests mimicking 30 years of wear.\n\nStill, there are no long-term data on how any of the latest implants will fare in actual patients. \"We have to install them and see,\" says Robert Namba, an orthopedic surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Irvine, Calif.\n\nThe biggest variable is patients themselves. As a rule, the more active they are, the faster their joints will wear out, loosen or require revision.\n\nMost orthopedic surgeons encourage patients with hip and knee implants to walk, swim and cycle as much as possible. Golf and doubles tennis are acceptable. But jogging, running, jumping and singles tennis are out. \"If your goal is a 30-year knee, you need to avoid high-impact sports,\" says John Wright, an orthopedic surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nThat said, some patients are determined to push the envelope, and some doctors give their blessing.\n\n\"If you have a brand new sports car and leave it in the garage, it will last forever and you won't have any fun,\" says Thomas Schmalzried, an orthopedic surgeon at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles. A former college basketball player, Dr. Schmalzried has patients who play competitive sports and run marathons with artificial joints. \"I know that the technology is capable of this level of athletic function. What I don't know\u2014what nobody knows\u2014is where the lines are for the average patient.\"\n\nSome doctors compromise and tell patients they can ski and surf if they were good at it before surgery, (and as long as they avoid skiing moguls).\n\n\"There's a happy medium, and it's not necessarily the same for every patient,\" says Dr. Berry. \"One might say, 'I'm willing to take a risk because that activity is important to me,' and another might not.\"\n\nPersonal quality of life issues are also important in deciding whether\u2014and when\u2014a patient is ready for joint-replacement surgery.\n\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't get on my motorcycle anymore,\" says Paul Canter, a picture framer from Los Angeles who had a double hip replacement at 63 last year.\n\nChris Schubert was kicked by a horse when she was 25, then suffered a near-fatal staph infection from a cortisone shot. Mounting pain and inflammation over the next 14 years forced her to quit recreational horseback riding, interrupted her sleep and interfered with her work as a building contractor. She had minimally invasive knee replacement surgery with Dr. Haas last year, at age 38, and her pain and limitations are gone. \"I thought my path in life was set and I'd just be miserable,\" she says. \"I never imagined my life could be this wonderful.\"\n\nPatients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort. \"Pre-hab\"\u2014building up strength before the surgery\u2014is just as important as re-hab afterward, they say.\n\n\"I was in the best shape of my life before I went in for the surgery,\" says Mr. Jeffries, the money manager, who trained twice a day for six months before his hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008.\n\nAnd staying as fit and strong as possible is also critical to joint preservation. \"I made up my mind. If I was going to go through all this surgery and rehab, I wanted to make these hips last as long as they possibly can,\" says Carol Espel, 55, an executive of Equinox Fitness who damaged both hips dancing professionally and teaching fitness for years.

cancerous breast cancer tissue may help reduce repeat surgeries after lumpectomy without compromising cosmetic effects, according to a new study.\n\nThe device, called MarginProbe, emits an electric field and senses a return signal from the tissue examined. Cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue, the researchers explained.\n\n\"This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,\" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.\n\nThe study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.\n\n\"The reality is, most of the time we leave the operating room and we don't know if we have a clear margin [with all cancer removed] or not,\" Boolbol said. Doctors wait for the pathology report to find that out, which can take a week or two. With the new device, the wait time is about five minutes.\n\n\"Everything still goes through pathology,\" Boolbol said. But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said.\n\nBoolbol is scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's breast cancer symposium in San Francisco.\n\nIn June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. The FDA usually follows the advisory panel's recommendations, so device approval is anticipated.\n\nFor the study, Boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned 495 breast cancer patients to receive the MarginProbe after lumpectomy or not receive it. Of those, 161 had early cancer known as ductal carcinoma in situ. The others had invasive cancers.\n\nWhere the device detected cancer cells near the edge or surface of the sample examined, surgeons removed additional tissue in the same procedure.\n\nTypically, about 40 percent of lumpectomy patients need another surgery because of the difficulty distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells in tissue around the tumor.\n\n\"We looked at whether we could lower the [repeat surgery] rate by using this device,\" Boolbol said.

tend not to discuss it publicly.\n\nAlthough the company selling Xiaflex will be Auxilium Pharmaceuticals of Malvern, Pa., the F.D.A. approval was a belated triumph for the drug\u2019s original developer, BioSpecifics Technologies of Lynbrook, N.Y., on Long Island. Founded in 1957, it struggled for decades to find uses for the product, almost going out of business before licensing the drug to Auxilium in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt sort of proves to people that if you really believe in a drug you should never give up,\u201d said Matthew Geller, a biotechnology investment banker who is a member of the BioSpecifics board.\n\nShares of BioSpecifics closed Monday at $27.61, up from $1 as recently as late 2006.\n\nSome people treated with Xiaflex in clinical trials for the Dupuytren\u2019s hand condition said it had made a big difference in their lives, and had allowed them to avoid painful surgery.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked down and saw my finger straightened out, I cried,\u201d said Kenneth Nelson, 65, of Indianapolis. \u201cIt was to me just like a miracle.\u201d\n\nXiaflex is an enzyme produced by a gangrene-causing bacterium, Clostridium histolyticum, which uses it to eat away the tissues of its victims. The enzyme, called collagenase, breaks down collagen, a major component of the body\u2019s connective tissue that is found in skin, tendons, cartilage and other organs.\n\nBut collagenase by itself does not cause gangrene. And there are times doctors need to break down collagen, such as when an excess builds up in the hand or penis, causing Dupuytren\u2019s and Peyronie\u2019s. The ailments are named for French surgeons who described the conditions in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe enzyme was first extracted from the bacteria around 1950 by Ines Mandl, a young biochemist at Columbia University. Edwin H. Wegman, a Long Island entrepreneur, learned about Dr. Mandl\u2019s work and set up a company called Advance Biofactures, which later became BioSpecifics, to turn collagenase into a drug.\n\nIn 1965, the company won approval of an ointment containing collagenase for use in removing dead tissue from skin ulcers and burns. The ointment, sold by licensees under the name Santyl, was a modest success, but the company never truly prospered.\n\nSo in the 1970s the company began developing what it thought would be a bigger money-maker, an injectable collagenase. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. Finally, in the early 1990s, two professors of orthopedics at the nearby State University of New York at Stony Brook suggested using the drug for Dupuytren\u2019s.\n\nThe professors, Dr. Lawrence C. Hurst and Marie A. Badalamente, injected the drug into the tails of rats, as a stand-in for human fingers. They found they could dissolve the collagen in tendons, making the tails floppy, without harming nearby nerves and arteries. Then they organized clinical trials in patients and got federal grants to help pay for the work. The professors and Stony Brook will share a royalty of one half of 1 percent of sales of Xiaflex for use in treating Dupuytren\u2019s.\n\nBut work was slowed by lack of money, and by 2004, BioSpecifics was about out of cash. In desperation, Ed Wegman\u2019s son Mark, a top computer scientist at I.B.M., called a childhood friend, Laurence Korn, who had been the chief executive of a successful biotechnology company now known as PDL BioPharma.\n\nWith Dr. Korn\u2019s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially.\n\nAuxilium was interested because of Peyronie\u2019s disease. It already was selling a gel for men with low testosterone and had learned from urologists about the need for better treatments for bent penises.\n\n\u201cFrom talking with surgeons and patients who have Peyronie\u2019s, neither of them wants to do the surgery,\u201d said Will Sargent, a spokesman for Auxilium.\n\nTwo years ago, the drug giant Pfizer, which sells the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, licensed the European rights to Xiaflex from Auxilium for an initial payment of $75 million. BioSpecifics got $6.4 million of that amount and will receive 8.5 percent of additional payments of up to $410 million that Pfizer might make.\n\nAuxilium sought approval for treating Dupuytren\u2019s first because it was easier to measure success in straightening fingers. But the company hopes to begin late-stage trials of Xiaflex for Peyronie\u2019s disease later this year. In a midstage trial, injections of Xiaflex into the collagen plaque in the penis reduced the curvature. But the drug did not reduce pain or discomfort during intercourse by a statistically significant amount.\n\nWhile collagenase itself is not patented, the companies do have patents on the use of the enzyme to treat Dupuytren\u2019s and Peyronie\u2019s. They are also shielded from competition for seven years under a federal law aimed at spurring development of drugs for rare, or \u201corphan,\u201d diseases \u2014 even though newer estimates suggest these two diseases are not as rare as thought when the drugs were given orphan status.\n\nAuxilium and BioSpecifics hope that the half-century-old collagenase might eventually become as versatile as Botox, another bacterial product. They are looking at uses that range from loosening up immobile \u201cfrozen shoulders\u201d to eliminating fat bulges and cellulite.\n\nWith its belated success, BioSpecifics has sold off its ointment business. It now has only five employees and a business of collecting a roughly 11 to 12 percent royalty on sales of Xiaflex.\n\n\u201cWe will be a cash machine going forward,\u201d said Thomas L.

known as vitamin D3 -- was linked to a marked reduction in menstrual cramps, with the largest benefits observed in women reporting the most pain at the beginning of the study.\n\nU.S. experts cautioned that it's too early to recommend vitamin D3 to those experiencing cramps -- estimated to occur in at least half of all reproductive-age women -- because the study didn't delve into possible

two months, average pain scores dropped 41 percent for women assigned vitamin D treatment, while no difference in pain was reported in the placebo group.\n\nAlso, the women who took vitamin D reported no need to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as the pain reliever ibuprofen, to manage their pain in the two-month study period, while 40 percent of those assigned to placebo reported using an NSAID at least once.\n\nMenstrual cramps, known by the medical name dysmenorrhea, typically begin just before or at the start of a woman's menstrual period and can last several days.

scans can reduce the risk of lung cancer death among former and current heavy smokers was celebrated by national heath officials this month. A major government study found the screening scans saved the life of one person for every 300 current or former smokers who were scanned.\n\nBut now cancer and screening experts are worried that the limited findings will be used by private screening centers to promote the test to a broader group than was studied. That, in turn, could lead to thousands of unnecessary lung scans, causing excess radiation exposure and unnecessary biopsies and surgery.\n\nDr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said he was stunned to hear a radio advertisement for an Atlanta screening center cite the study just a few days after the government had announced the results. The wording of the ad seemed to be aimed at a broad group, ranging from heavy smokers to women who had never smoked, Dr. Brawley said.\n\n\u201cWe really need to weigh the harms associated with screening,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scientific community still needs to digest this. To take a trial that involves people at high risk for lung cancer and to extrapolate it and say it\u2019s good for people with intermediate or low risk is not appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, focused on a specific high-risk group: 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, who had smoked for at least 30 pack-years. That means someone who smoked one pack a day for 30 years, two packs a day for 15 years or three packs a day for at least 10 years would qualify for the study.\n\nFormer smokers who had accumulated 30 pack-years were included only if they had stopped smoking within the previous 15 years.\n\nThe smokers and former smokers were given either annual CT lung scans or chest X-rays. Compared with conventional X-rays, the CT, or computed tomography, scans create a detailed three-dimensional image of the lungs. The study was stopped when it was found that the scanning group had a 20 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer than those being screened with X-rays.\n\nBut the early results also showed a downside of scanning: one of every four lung scans showed an abnormality, which often led to additional worry, radiation exposure from follow-up scans and, sometimes, lung biopsies and even risky surgery. But because the study was stopped early, a full analysis of the harms caused by screening scans is still months away.\n\nReading the scans is tricky because harmless nodules can be misinterpreted as suspect lesions. In the study, even experienced radiologists at major cancer centers had a high rate of false positives, suggesting that the rate would be even higher in the real world.\n\n\u201cThere is a learning curve to reading spiral CTs,\u201d Dr. Brawley said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that some radiologists might be early in that learning curve and some patients may be harmed because of it.\u201d\n\nWhile the study found a benefit to scanning a specific group of high-risk smokers, that doesn\u2019t mean other groups will get the same benefit, says Dr. Peter B.

Drug company patient-assistance programs \u2014 which help patients cover co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs \u2014 are abhorred by economists because they shield patients from treatment costs and undermine the ability of insurers to steer patients to less expensive options.\nIn addition, an accompanying video states \u201ca billion and a half dollars\u201d was spent developing the drug but doesn\u2019t point out that the purported development cost is small compared with the potential profits. If all 300,000 people the manufacturers of this drug say are \u201cmost in need of treatment options\u201d receive this drug, the total cost could be as high as $11 billion a year, funds that must be diverted from other healthcare priorities or come from higher premiums or taxes. That broader analysis was missing in this story.\nAn independent draft analysis showed dupilumab did improve health outcomes compared to usual care but with additional costs, and that the drug did fall below commonly cited standards for cost-effectiveness.

dry needling in \u201crunner\u2019s knee,\u201d the condition that has plagued Pierce.", "Their goal, and the goal of other researchers now looking at dry needling, is to produce results rigorous enough to show whether it really works.", "For now, here\u2019s what consumers should know:", "Physical therapists say it is not, \u201cthough superficially, it may look the same,\u201d says Justin Elliott, vice president of government affairs for the American Physical Therapy Association.", "For one thing, he says, dry needling as performed by a physical therapist is not rooted in ancient Chinese medicine \u2014 there\u2019s no talk about redirecting the body\u2019s energy flow by placing needles at certain points in the body.", "Instead, needles are placed directly in problem areas.", "Elliott says dry needling also is practiced by some chiropractors, naturopathic physicians and nurses, which puts it outside the realm of any one specialty.", "Acupuncturists beg to differ.", "\u201cWhat is being called dry needling is clearly a form of acupuncture\u201d and should be done only by professionals extensively trained in that discipline, says Thomas Burgoon, a West Chester, Pa., physician who is president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture.", "He says many acupuncturists do exactly what the physical therapists describe, with the same kind of needles.", "Burgoon\u2019s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice.", "How might it work?", "One theory is that the needles cause tight muscles to twitch, then relax.", "The needles may also increase blood flow or set off nerve responses that alter pain perception, Briggs says.", "Another possibility: It\u2019s a placebo effect, an improvement triggered by the expectation that a treatment will work rather than by the treatment itself.", "To look for that possibility, the Ohio State study will compare patients who get the real needle treatment to those poked with sham needles that don\u2019t pierce the skin.", "Mark Crislip, an infectious-disease doctor in Portland, Ore., who recently wrote about dry needling for Science-Based Medicine \u2014 a website critical of alternative medicine \u2014 says the version practiced by physical therapists doesn\u2019t \u201ccome with the mystical baggage that accompanies acupuncture.\u201d But he says it may well be a \u201ctheatrical placebo.\u201d", "What do published studies say?", "\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag,\u201d Elliott says.", "In a 2011 review, the physical therapy association rated the evidence for dry needling a 3 out of 5, based on the best studies.", "A formal analysis of 35 trails on acupuncture and dry needling for chronic lower back pain was published by the Cochrane research group in 2005.", "It found they \u201cmay be useful\u201d additions to standard treatment.", "But it said higher quality studies were needed.", "What are the risks?", "Needling can produce minor bleeding and some soreness, but in trained hands, and with the use of sterile needles and gloves, \u201cit\u2019s a very safe procedure,\u201d Briggs says.", "In rare cases, deep needling can lead to a punctured lung or injuries to nerves and blood vessels, and acupuncturists fear non-specialists will be more likely to make such mistakes, Burgoon says.", "Will insurers pay for this?", "Many will not.", "Charges for patients can range from $10 to $75 per session, says Edo Zylstra, CEO of KinetaCore, a company that offers intensive three-day weekend courses in dry needling to physical therapists.", "Do all physical therapists offer this?", "No.", "The physical therapy association tells members in seven states to steer clear because of recent court or regulatory decisions or language in existing licensing laws.", "They are: California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, New York, South Dakota and Washington.", "And most of the nation\u2019s 200,000 licensed physical therapists are not trained in the

help them to regain more control over their movements and allow more of them to live independently, scientists said Monday.\n\nIn the largest study yet of the effect of this type of antidepressant on stroke recovery, French researchers found that stroke patients given Prozac improved their scores in motor skills tests more than those given a placebo, or dummy pill.\n\nExperts commenting on the findings said they had \u201cenormous potential to change clinical practice\u201d and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant.\n\nStroke is the single largest cause of adult disability and the third-largest cause of death in the developed world.\n\nThe cost of caring for its victims, who often have motor function difficulties like paralysis or weakness on one side, puts a heavy burden on already stretched healthcare systems.\n\nA few previous small trials had already suggested that giving drugs like Prozac, which belongs to a drug class known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might improve motor skill recovery after stroke.\n\nProzac was developed by Eli Lilly and is now available in a cheaper generic form as fluoxetine.\n\nHemiplegia \u2014 paralysis to one side of the body \u2014 and hemiparesis \u2014 weakness on one side of the body \u2014 are the most common disabilities after stroke and scientists believe SSRIs might help improve movement by increasing the level of the brain chemical serotonin in the central nervous system.\n\n\u201cThe positive effect of the drug on motor function... suggests that the neuronal ... action of SSRIs provides a new pathway that should be explored further,\u201d said Francois Chollet of Toulouse University Hospital, who led this research.\n\nIn the study, conducted between March 2005 and June 2009 and published in The Lancet Neurology journal Monday, 118 patients in France were given either Prozac or a placebo for three months starting between five and 10 days after they had suffered a stroke.\n\nAll patients were also given physiotherapy, and had their motor skills tested at the start of the trial and on day 90.\n\nSignificantly greater improvements in motor function were recorded after three months in patients taking Prozac, where the average test score improved by 34.0 points, than in the placebo group, where the average improvement was 24.3 points.\n\nThere were also more independent patients and depression was less common in the Prozac group than in the placebo group, and side effects of the drug were rare and mild, researchers said.\n\nCommenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time.\n\nRoger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses.\n\n\u201cDepression after stroke is a common enough complication to have raised the question of treating with antidepressants early after stroke,\u201d he said in an emailed comment. \u201cIf motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "It mentions that the drug

Women with sleep apnea may suffer poorer heart health than men, according to a recent study.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea occurs when the soft tissues of the mouth and airway, especially the tongue, block air flow into the lungs.

The drop in oxygen while sleeping is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, say experts.\n\nAfter being diagnosed, Turner tried an external continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which proved too cumbersome for her continued use. What's more, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the bulky CPAP machines \u2014 standard treatment for many patients with sleep apnea \u2014 doesn't help prevent heart attacks or stroke, although it does help patients sleep better and improve mood.\n\nInstead, Turner underwent a relatively new procedure: implanting a pacemaker-like device called Inspire for obstructive sleep apnea. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014, the device is a remote-controlled chest implant plus two thin wires that runs under the skin monitoring a patient\u2019s breath, delivering a mild electric current at night.\n\nA clinical trial of Inspire therapy found a 78 percent reduction in the number of sleep apnea events per hour for patients.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely an interesting solution for a good number of people,\u201d said Capasso.\n\nInspire is an invasive procedure, so it is not recommended as a first-line treatment and not everyone is a candidate.\n\nThe price tag for the Inspire device is $20,000, with surgery costing extra.

Institute of Technology, with backing from five scientists who are Nobel prize recipients, is wading into the murky world of dietary supplements with a new antiaging pill that is said to restore muscle tissue, improve brain function, and increase energy levels by improving \u201cmetabolic health.\u201d\n\nLeonard Guarente, one of the best-known antiaging researchers in the region, and the roster of eminent scientists have formed Elysium Health, which on Tuesday will debut its first product, a pill called Basis. They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism.\n\nMany products in the supplement business are launched with questionable science, but Elysium said studies in mice show a clear connection between increased levels of this compound, called NAD, and improved health in older mice.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of new findings in the past five years identifying some extremely promising compounds that promote wellness and health. [We want to] make them available for people to improve their health before they get sick,\u201d said Guarente, an Elysium Health founder and its chief scientific officer. \u201cWe are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.\u201d\n\nThe active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries.

I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.\n\nThis posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.\n\nWhy the flu vaccine isn't always effective\n\nThe flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.\n\nThe challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction \u2014 based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies \u2014 and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.\n\nThis may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.\n\nIn kids, the highest-quality evidence \u2014 a randomized controlled trial \u2014 suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.\n\nIn adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. \"Depending on the season,\" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, \"you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms.\" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.\n\nJefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.\n\nThat seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn \u2014 the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, \"Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.\"\n\nOne key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments \u2014 ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials \u2014 they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.\n\nIn the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn't get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it's impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.\n\nAgain, though, this doesn't mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: \"Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.\"\n\nWhy people still bother to get the shot\n\nDespite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.\n\nFor one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There's also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there's little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.\n\nAs Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, \"Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect.\" He continued: \"However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.\"\n\nWelcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers can submit everyday health questions.

I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.", "This posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.", "Why the flu vaccine isn't always effective", "The flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.", "The challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction \u2014 based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies \u2014 and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.", "This may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.", "In kids, the highest-quality evidence \u2014 a randomized controlled trial \u2014 suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.", "In adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. \"Depending on the season,\" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, \"you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms.\" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.", "Jefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.", "On the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.", "That seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn \u2014 the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, \"Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.\"", "One key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality.

An endometriosis pain treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it\u2019s expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August.

And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can\u2019t shed.\n\nEvery month, a woman\u2019s uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she\u2019s not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus \u2014 on the fallopian tubes, or even in the nose or lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can\u2019t go through the vagina since it\u2019s not growing in the uterus), it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility.\n\nThere\u2019s no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don\u2019t always work.

This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it\u2019s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis.\n\nDoctors aren\u2019t sure why some women get it\n\nAdding to the mystery around endometriosis: No one knows exactly what causes it, but doctors have some theories.\n\u2022 Retrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.\n\u2022 Genes: The disorder runs in families, so doctors believe there\u2019s a genetic component. If a woman\u2019s mom or sister had endometriosis, the woman is believed to be at a higher risk.\n\u2022 Somatic mutations: Researchers are also finding that somatic mutations \u2014 acquired changes to DNA that happen after a person is born \u2014 may also be an endometriosis driver.\n\u2022 Immune system dysfunction: Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman\u2019s ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis.\n\u2022 Environmental factors: There\u2019s some evidence to suggest environmental exposures to certain chemicals may contribute to one\u2019s risk of developing endometriosis.\n\nThe treatments available don\u2019t always help, and some have severe side effects\n\nWhen birth control pills or over-the-counter painkillers fail to help endometriosis pain, women are often left choosing between a monthly injection called Lupron Depot, which can put women into a profoundly menopausal state, or Danazol, a male hormone that often causes acne and facial hair growth.\n\nIn women for whom these drugs aren\u2019t effective, or who don\u2019t want to take medications, surgery to remove the displaced endometrial tissue can be a highly effective option. But the trouble with surgery is that endometriosis can recur, so women may need more surgeries. The success of surgery also depends on finding a skilled and experienced surgeon, and there\u2019s always the risk of surgical complications.\n\nThe new drug elagolix is not risk-free, either. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn\u2019t entirely surprising.

It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.\n\nBefore deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.\n\nI had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23.

Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder \u2014 to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.\n\nAfter what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.\n\nFerrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. \u201cWe want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,\u2019\u2019 Ferrell says.\n\nBecause there is not yet enough research on PRP \u2014 and because some studies have shown mixed results \u2014 insurance will not cover it.\n\nStill, \u201cit has significant cost savings\u201d compared with surgery, Ferrell says.

The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.\n\nI had it on March 4.\n\nWhen I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good.

Even though she continued to diet and work out, she had no change in her thighs, belly and hips. Her doctor offered her three more sessions at no cost. Still, no change.\n\nSince most aesthetic medicine is elective, and not covered by insurance, marketing plays a major role in capturing the minds and wallets of consumers. The concern is that promoting innovations for indications that the Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved will fuel patient expectations that clinical data may not substantiate.\n\nZeltiq Aesthetics, based in Pleasanton, Calif., is a cautious wallflower that aims to get the data behind its device approved by the F.D.A. before it makes too rowdy an entrance to the party. Its slogan is \u201cMore Science.

(In general, the F.D.A. must sanction a medical device for a specific use before a company can market that use. But doctors are free to use devices off label. )\n\nNonetheless, a brochure for Zerona states patients can collectively \u201close up to 9 inches without the pain or down time of surgery.\u201d Nationwide, medical spas, chiropractors, cosmetic surgeons, plastic surgeons and dermatologists now offer Zerona for $1,700 to $3,800 for six sessions. Part of the reason the device has made inroads during these strapped times is that doctors don\u2019t buy it outright, but pay per use.\n\nSo how is Zerona supposed to work? The low-level laser causes \u201cfat to seep out of a cell, almost like a balloon being struck by a needle,\u201d said Ryan Maloney, medical director for Erchonia Medical. The fat enters the lymphatic system, and is eventually used as energy, Dr. Maloney said.\n\nZeltiq uses controlled cooling to target and eliminate fat cells, a process called selective cryolipolysis. Skin isn\u2019t damaged, but subcutaneous fat, which is more sensitive to targeted cold, begins a two-month death march soon after exposure to Zeltiq.\n\nDoctors on the advisory board for Zeltiq Aesthetics have put the word out about it on television news segments. But at this stage, the company itself has been careful not to promote its device directly to consumers since its F.D.A. clearances for, say, pain reduction during dermatologic treatments don\u2019t encompass fat reduction. Gordie Nye, the chief executive, sent an e-mail message declining to be interviewed for this article.\n\nThe company has clinical data that has been submitted to the F.D.A. for approval, according to a few doctors who were principal investigators. Data relayed at a meeting of the American Society of Dermatologic Surgery showed a 22 percent reduction of the fat layer as measured by ultrasound.\n\nErchonia Medical has published the results of its clinical trial in Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. Thirty-five patients in the treatment group lost an average of 3.5 inches total in hips, thighs and their midsection according to the company\u2019s clinical trial. The company has promoted Zerona as \u201ca new body-sculpting procedure designed to remove fat and contour the body without invasive surgery.\u201d But the F.D.A. has not sanctioned marketing this use. It has cleared the Zerona laser for pain reduction 24 hours after breast augmentation or as a way to decrease the pain associated with recovering from liposuction.\n\nIn general, Karen Riley, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said \u201cit is considered off-label promotion if you are marketing to the public a use that has not been cleared.\u201d Steven Shanks, the president of Erchonia Medical, said, \u201cSince we use the exact same power for liposuction and breast augmentation, we self-certified the device.\u201d He said that in January 2009, the company had applied for a 510K clearance \u2014 which is based on the notion that an older device is substantially equivalent to a new one \u2014 and had yet to receive it. (Such a delay is atypical, Ms. Riley said, adding, \u201cmost 510Ks are cleared within six months.\u201d)\n\nLast month, Dr. Robert B. Seltzer, a dermatologist in Pasadena, Calif., ran an advertisement in The Los Angeles Times for an informational seminar that called Zerona \u201cthe holy grail.\u201d In a phone interview, however, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent convinced\u201d and planned to return his Zerona if he didn\u2019t continue seeing results in his patients.

Kenkel, vice chairman of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Dr. Kenkel, who recently replicated results of Zerona\u2019s clinical trial in 12 of his patients, doesn\u2019t offer Zerona to obese patients, or to ones who have had surgery in the area they want treated. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to be evaluated by a doctor,\u201d he said.\n\nSuccess is also dependent on diet and exercise, he said. If you\u2019re sedentary and not eating healthy food, he said, then once fat is leaked after Zerona treatments, \u201cyour body will just store it again.\u201d\n\nHow the body rids itself of fat, and how quickly, after any noninvasive body slimming procedure is unclear, said Dr. Lawrence S. Bass, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan who started using a Zeltiq device last July. That includes, he said, forthcoming devices like UltraShape and LipoSonix, which employ ultrasound waves to single out fat. It\u2019s a \u201csticking point with the F.D.A. with all these things,\u201d he said. Dr. Bass was not a clinical investigator for Zeltiq, but he said, \u201cI\u2019m convinced both on the science and clinical experience, it\u2019s able to eliminate fat noninvasively.\u201d\n\nNadine Tosk, a publicist for Zeltiq, explained that the rollout of the device was \u201cvery limited right now.\u201d Dr. Jeffrey Dover, a dermatologist in Chestnut Hill, Mass., who advises Zeltiq and participated in its clinical trial, said a few board-certified plastic surgeons and dermatologists were \u201chandpicked\u201d because \u201cwe know they do good work.\u201d Restraint is key, he said, because a doctor could apply Zeltiq to \u201cthe same spot\u201d in the same day, which isn\u2019t how it\u2019s meant to be used. Hourlong treatments are best spaced out by two months, said Dr. Dover, who charges $700 per spot.\n\nThat said, a doctor with a Zeltiq device isn\u2019t hard for patients to find. More than five dozen \u201cZeltiq specialists\u201d can be found by ZIP code at body-contouring.com, which is a patient guide not sponsored by manufacturers of body-slimming devices. Dr. Jason N.

More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.\n\nAs Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.\n\n\"That to me is unacceptable,\" Insel says.\n\nIt hasn't been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There's screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.\n\nAn effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide \u2014 depression \u2014 is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.\n\nThat approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.\n\nLynn, who's now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness \"is like the pain of having a cancer,\" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts \u2014 at times almost monthly.\n\n\"When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,\" she says. \"I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in.\" Sometimes she couldn't find anything to hang on to. \"Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,\" she says.\n\nThe program that saved Lynn almost didn't get off the ground.\n\nFifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.\n\nSome of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called \"perfect depression care\" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.\n\nThe mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.\n\nThe plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.\n\nIf the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care \u2014 cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient's medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.\n\nTherapists involve patients' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don't leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with \"safety plans.\"\n\nLynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists' phone numbers. And there's a reminder that the feeling will pass \u2014 it has before.\n\nBefore the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn't work very well, she says.\n\nToday, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. \"There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,\" says Espiritu, \"and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan.\" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.\n\nFor Lynn, the key was persistence \u2014 her therapists', and her own. \"I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, 'I don't believe there's hope, I don't see it, I don't feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it's not there,' \" she recalls.\n\nHer therapists never gave up. \"There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,\" Lynn says. Over the years she's been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.\n\nThe Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.\n\nEspiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: \"There was a lot of, 'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?' \" Some people didn't think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.\n\nStill, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, \"we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,\" he says. It's crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that's still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization's general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.\n\nThere's reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.\n\nOfficials at Henry Ford say they haven't analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.\n\nWhy push for zero, rather than just a reduction? \"Because if you say we're OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,\" says Espiritu. \"We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves.\" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.\n\nAnd as for Lynn, she doesn't consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she's received at Henry Ford, she's learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease. And she's alive. That, she says, makes her a big success story.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "At issue in the story is the health system\u2019s so-called \u201cperfect depression care,\u201d which incorporates depression screening into primary care. Patients deemed to have, or be at risk of, depression are then given appropriate treatment. It\u2019s difficult to pin a specific cost to this. The matter is further complicated by the fact that treating depression can also save money by driving down costs related to associated health problems. However, the story notes that Centerstone \u2014 a separate health system that has adopted the Henry Ford Health System\u2019s model for a smaller cohort of patients \u2014 did do a cost/benefit analysis and found that it resulted in savings of more than $400,000 per year. While we\u2019ll award a Satisfactory, we think there was a muddling here of Henry Ford\u2019s global screening strategy with the intense care provision in the Centerstone model. It is not appropriate to apply the cost analysis of the latter to the former. In addition, it can be argued that\u00a0screening every patient at every visit it wasteful.

clinical trial suggests.\n\nGleevec (imatinib) reduced the \"twitchiness\" of airways, making them less likely to reflexively constrict when exposed to an allergen or asthma trigger, said senior researcher Dr. Elliot Israel.\n\n\"We showed we could decrease the amount of airway twitchiness by a third,\" Israel said. \"That's a substantial change, and that was significant compared with the placebo group.\"\n\nIsrael is director of the respiratory therapy department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nThe drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn't expected, Israel said.\n\nPeople whose severe asthma isn't controlled despite use of high-dose steroid medications are at risk of declining lung function and poor quality of life, the researchers said in background notes.\n\nBut, this powerful cancer drug can't be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted.\n\nGleevec fights leukemia by blocking a specific receptor on cancerous white blood cells, inhibiting their ability to multiply and spread, Israel said.\n\nThat same action also affects mast cells, a type of white blood cell distributed throughout the body that promotes inflammation and causes allergic reactions, Israel said.\n\nFor example, mast cells in the skin are responsible for hives, while mast cells in the lungs have been associated with severe asthma, he said.\n\n\"By blocking the signal that helps keep mast cells alive, we were hoping to reduce the number of these cells,\" Israel said. \"By doing that, we hoped to produce improvements beyond the maximal therapy that these patients with severe asthma are on.\"\n\nIsrael and his colleagues recruited 62 severe asthma sufferers for the study. All received top-notch asthma treatment, and were randomly assigned to take either Gleevec or a placebo pill once daily during the 6-month trial.\n\nBlood tests showed that Gleevec did reduce mast cell activity in patients, Israel said.\n\nFurther, allergy challenge tests showed a decrease in airway reactivity among patients taking Gleevec, the researchers reported. Airways became less likely to close off after exposure to an allergen.\n\nPhysical examinations showed that people taking Gleevec actually experienced a slight overall widening of their airways, Israel added.\n\n\"There was a small but significant improvement in the airway narrowing in these patients, which we didn't expect because we didn't think the mast cells were necessarily promoting that airway narrowing all the time,\" Israel said.\n\nSide-effects were not as severe as expected, he added.

Could getting vaccinated be as easy as putting on a bandage? Could there be fewer, or at least smaller, needles in our future?\n\nSome companies and academic labs are working to make those things happen.\n\nThey're refining technologies that involve tiny needles, less than a millimeter long, and needle-free injectors that can send a dose of vaccine through your skin in a fraction of a second.\n\nSome of these technologies are already available on the market, while others are still being tested.\n\nA flu vaccine patch is not yet available to the public. But one version developed by Georgia Tech's Laboratory for Drug Delivery showed promising results in its first human clinical trial, according to a study published in The Lancet in June.\n\nThe patch, about the size of a small square bandage, has tiny, dissolvable needles filled with a dose of flu vaccine. It's placed on the arm and activated through pressure. The microneedles dissolve into the skin, releasing the vaccine.\n\nIn the study, 100 participants received either the flu vaccine patch, a standard flu shot or a placebo via a patch.\n\nSix months later, no one involved in the study had gotten the flu. People in the microneedle patch groups reported some redness, itching and tenderness but no serious side effects.\n\nPeople who received the flu patch had comparable immune responses to people who had gotten the flu shot.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the patients in the study preferred the patch to the regular shot, says Yasmine Gomaa, the lab's associate director.\n\nNow, Gomaa's lab is looking beyond the flu vaccine. She says the microneedle patch could be particularly helpful in developing countries because it uses a form of vaccines that doesn't need to be kept as cold as regular vaccines. It can be stored at temperatures as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit for up to a year, she says.\n\nAnd the patch can be administered by people who aren't trained health professionals.

smoking, without cravings or side effects?\n\nThat\u2019s what Innovative Laser Therapy, a New Haven, Connecticut-based company, advertises on its website. The clinic uses low-level lasers - similar to those sometimes used to treat arthritis-related pain - to target specific acupuncture points on the body related to addiction, metabolism and stress, and claims that most patients can quit smoking after one session.\n\nIn that session, the laser is pointed at spots on the face, hands and wrist, with the aim of relieving withdrawal symptoms and preventing cravings.\n\n\u201cWhen you smoke a cigarette, you artificially tell your brain to release endorphins,\u201d Frank Pinto, the owner of Innovative Laser Therapy, told Reuters Health.

Institute in Squirrel Hill.\n\nWith childhood autism cases skyrocketing and no cure in sight, doctors at the Children's Institute in Squirrel Hill are planning on a Hail Mary pass approach to the mysterious disorder -- housing young patients for weeks at a time in a pollutant-free \"clean room,\" in an attempt to detoxify their bodies.\n\nNo cause for autism has been found, and debates rage as to whether the brain development disorder is purely genetic or caused in part by environmental factors, including air and food-borne chemicals.\n\nWith roots in autism treatment theories that until now have lived mostly on the Internet, the pediatric clean room plan would be the first of its kind in a mainstream American hospital environment.\n\nThe Children Institute's Scott Faber, a pediatrician with several hundred autistic patients and a waiting list six months long, is one of the believers in toxic causes, and the institute is trying to back him with a multimillion dollar test of the novel theory.\n\nUnder the plans -- developed with help from Duquesne University -- autistic patients would live for more than six weeks in a 1,000-square-foot room kept mostly free of harmful chemicals and pollutants, using special air-filtering systems, ultraviolet lights and air locks on doorways.\n\nFurniture, paints, toys and floor coverings would be designed to be toxin-free, and food, clothing and water organic and clean. Doctors would seek to rid patients' bodies of chemicals and boost their immune systems through natural means such as nutritional supplements and dietary changes.\n\nBasically, it would be pushing a \"reset\" button on the child's body, with the hope of wiping autistic symptoms away.\n\n\"What we would like to do is have kids live in this wonderful environment where they are exposed to almost none of the Industrial Revolution. And we wonder, if the chemicals come out and the heavy metals come out, will the children start improving?\" Dr. Faber said.\n\n\"Will they start showing signs of clinical improvement, such as language improvement and socialization improvement? Will they become less obsessive? Less fascinated?\"\n\nAutism is one of a group of developmental disabilities disorders that cause substantial impairments in social interaction and communication and are characterized by unusual behaviors and interests. Many people with these disorders also have unusual ways of learning, paying attention and reacting to sensation. Rates have greatly increased in recent years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though some of the rise may be due to changes in reporting and diagnosing the disorder.\n\nPlanning and fund-raising for the \"Environmental Pediatric Room\" is in the early stages, with the Alcoa Foundation awarding an initial $200,000 grant April 28. It will require an estimated $500,000 to fully design and at least $1 million in yearly operating support its first three years.\n\nThe 106-year-old Children's Institute (formerly called the Rehabilitation Institute) plans to fund the room through the $30 million capital campaign it launched in 2005, after buying out its Shady Avenue site from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. It completed an expansion last year that doubled its building space and its capacity, from 39 to 82 beds. Almost $24 million of the campaign total has been raised, with fund-raising for the clean room and other programs ongoing.\n\nClean rooms are common in high-tech manufacturing and research environments and have been used in hospital settings for patients struggling with infectious diseases and transplants. They have also been used to treat children with autism, but only in patients' homes, largely in work by Virginia researcher and nutritionist Karen Slimak.\n\nDr. Faber noted that Ms. Slimak's clean room work -- like much of the research on toxicity in autism -- \"hasn't been written for the main [scientific] literature\" but instead has been written mostly for the Internet. The Children's Institute plan would be taking what is arguably a fringe movement into the mainstream: It would be the first autism treatment of this kind staged in an American hospital setting. It will be matched with scientific analysis, sensors and video cameras to study the real impacts of detoxification. The data and findings will be shared openly, he said.\n\nWith so many doubts -- and so few answers -- about effective autism treatments among the growing community of families affected by the condition, the institute said openness is vital to the experimental method's success.\n\n\"We're not saying this is the full cause\" of autism and related illnesses, Dr. Faber said. \"Obviously there are multiple causes, and there are going to be found many genetic causes, many environmental causes and many genetic-environmental interactions. But we wonder -- we speculate -- that it's possible if we have children living in a unique environment that has not [previously] been created scientifically that we can make a difference.\n\n\"We want to have it be very transparent to the world what we're doing. We want this to be basically an intellectual exercise that's shared with everyone.\"\n\nEducational, physical, speech and behavioral therapies have long been the traditional treatments for autism, but a growing number of families and researchers have called for further biomedical treatments as well, suspecting there is a chemical side to the disorder.\n\nFamilies often say their environmental suspicions about the disorder aren't taken seriously.\n\n\"I can give you a detailed account of how I know that exposure to toxic mold has caused my son's autism. I have been saying it for years and no one believes me. They think I am crazy, even a [Defeat Autism Now doctor] we once saw,\" said a message posted by a parent on the AutismWeb.com bulletin board in March\n\nParents \"research anything they can get their hands on and there are so many things saying 'Try this or try that' that aren't necessarily safe. It's a frightening thing,\" said Kim Aburachis, of Peters, who has twin 10-year-old boys, Nathan and Tyler, with severe cases of autism. Her boys have seen Dr. Faber for more than seven years and are likely to take part in the clean room treatment.\n\n\"We're so excited, so enthusiastic, just for the hope of this,\" she said.\n\nElliot Frank, the chairman of Pittsburgh's Advisory Board on Autism and Related Disorders, said the proposed clean room should not raise any red flags. Even if it does not work, patients will be in a safe and professional environment, benefiting from passive treatments such as nutrition and clean air.\n\nAmong parents of children with autism, Mr. Frank said, \"some will say, 'Come on, who are you kidding?' But a significant portion of parents will feel good about this and watch this with incredible interest. Others will watch and say, 'Hmm, let's see what happens.' \"\n\nDr. Faber, 49, is a neurodevelopmental and developmental behavioral pediatrician with 24 years in the field, who came to the institute four years ago from Mercy Hospital. He has been working on the clean room concept for at least two years, alongside Duquesne University chemistry professor and environmental expert Skip Kingston.\n\nHe has been trying to build the scientific case that environmental factors such as toxic chemicals do trigger autistic symptoms. His findings are complicated, but basically blood tests show 70 percent of his autistic patients have zinc deficiencies (pointing to problems with processing heavy metals), and the vast majority also have immune system problems of varying kinds.\n\n\"We know that the data for this is just emerging, but we feel it's a very safe intervention, and it's empowering for families and very reasonable,\" he said.\n\nThe room would house only one patient at a time and be similar to other spaces at the institute's Center for Autism, with educational and play spaces, and a table for dining. Medical staff, teachers and family would have regular access to the room through an air-locked entrance, and another air lock would separate the room from a kitchen and laundry area. There will be a small bedroom for the child and a couch for a family member to stay overnight.\n\nTraditional therapies would continue during the patient's stay. But by exposing children to a clean atmosphere and toxic-free diet, doctors will also try to slowly release chemicals from the children's bodies, through their skin, urine and stool. In the meantime they will be living in a space that is anything but hospital or scientific-feeling.\n\n\"To parents and children it's going to be the opposite of a sterile environment. It's going to be home,\" Dr. Faber said. \"If it's not beautiful and it isn't nurturant, it doesn't fit our research plans.\"\n\nAt the outset, patients would be only the sickest children, who have not responded to other treatments. They would stay six to 12 weeks, allowing an estimated four to six children to be treated per year. (Twenty families have already expressed interest.) After leaving, spaces at each patient's home would be equipped with lower-level clean technology, such as ultraviolet lights and air filters, and children would continue with special diets.\n\nA six-week stay is not uncommon at Children's Institute, said president and chief executive officer David Miles, as patients with traumatic brain injuries, often from car or bike accidents, can stay for months at a time. The average stay in its acute care unit is 23 days.\n\nStill, he said the room poses some unique challenges.\n\n\"Talking to architects, the technology to create the room is out there. It's not really a problem,\" Mr. Miles said. \"It's really what you put in the room that is an issue.\"\n\nEquipment and gear for use in industrial clean rooms are easy to find, but educational materials, toys and normal-looking furniture are not. Most will have to be fabricated from scratch, using the help of students at Duquesne's Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences and other research teams. The institute also has to start from scratch on government permits, insurance issues and other red tape.\n\nFund-raising is the most obvious challenge facing the proposal. There is also the worry of raising expectations too high.\n\n\"We want to explore this hypothesis thoroughly,\" Dr. Faber said. \"But we can't promise we'll make any biologic difference or any kind of physiologic difference. What we want to do is to create a loving, nurturant environment where the kids are a gift to us and we're a gift to them, and it all works very nicely.\"\n\nFirst published on May 11, 2008 at 12:00 am", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This article does report costs estimated\u00a0to design the clean room, $500,000, and that a minimum of $1 million dollars annually will be needed to support operating expenses.\u00a0 Cost of the experimental approach were not reported and may not be available at this time because the project is still in the planning stage; however, it is estimated the operational costs will support the experimental approach for only\u00a0four to six experimental subjects per year.\u00a0 ", "answer": 1, "paragraphs": ["Dr. Scott Faber talks about the plan for an environmental pediatric room at the Children's Institute in Squirrel Hill.", "With childhood autism cases skyrocketing and no cure in sight, doctors at the Children's Institute in Squirrel Hill are planning on a Hail Mary pass approach to the mysterious disorder -- housing young patients for weeks at a time in a pollutant-free \"clean room,\" in an attempt to detoxify their bodies.", "No cause for autism has been found, and debates rage as to whether the brain development disorder is purely genetic or caused in part by environmental factors, including air and food-borne chemicals.", "With roots in autism treatment theories that until now have lived mostly on the Internet, the pediatric clean room plan would be the first of its kind in a mainstream American hospital environment.", "The Children Institute's Scott Faber, a pediatrician with several hundred autistic patients and a waiting list six months long, is one of the believers in toxic causes, and the institute is trying to back him with a multimillion dollar test of the novel theory.", "Under the plans -- developed with help from Duquesne University -- autistic patients would live for more than six weeks in a 1,000-square-foot room kept mostly free of harmful chemicals and pollutants, using special air-filtering systems, ultraviolet lights and air locks on doorways.", "Furniture, paints, toys and floor coverings would be designed to be toxin-free, and food, clothing and water organic and clean.

Most significantly, research showed a significant effect in reducing the risk of death with ACE inhibitors but not with ARBS. That led many doctors and standards groups to conclude that ACE inhibitors were more effective than ARBs.\n\nBut some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn't it show up in these types of studies?\n\nThat inconsistency created a confusing split in the medical community. Most guidelines set forth by the major medical groups suggest starting a patient with an ACE inhibitor first, but the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) considers ACE inhibitors and ARBs to be equal.\n\nBangalore noticed that one assumption made in comparing the placebo trials -- that the patients in the group were about the same -- was incorrect. During that time period there was a remarkable shift in cardiovascular health care in America -- with a greater emphasis on not smoking, more statin use for cholesterol, better management of diabetes, lower targets for blood pressure.\n\n\"The patients in the '80s and '90s were a higher-risk group than those in the 2000s,\" Bangalore explained. \"If your risk is higher it's easier to show a benefit. If your risk is lower it's harder to show a benefit.\"\n\nThe new analysis, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings on Monday, involves a second look at 106 randomized trials with 254,301 patients that took place after 2000 and shows that during this time period patient outcomes on the two medications were remarkably similar. The one difference they found was that ARBs tend to be better tolerated by patients, meaning that they have fewer side effects or result in fewer adverse events. ACE inhibitors are poorly tolerated by many patients because they can produce a bothersome dry cough, and some end up stopping medication as a result.\n\nBangalore said this is critically important because \"compliance is big issue with our patients.\"\n\n\"With hypertension they are on these medications for decades, and it's important to choose one that will be the most tolerable,\" he said.\n\nThe other piece of good news regarding the medications is that ACE inhibitors, as well as many ARBs, are now generic -- meaning that the cost difference is minimal.\n\nThe study was limited to patients who did not have heart failure, and because it involved a retrospective analysis of trials it was unable to control for differences in the design or data gathering of the previous work.\n\nHappiness won\u2019t help you live longer (but unhappiness won\u2019t kill you either)\n\nGuinea is finally declared Ebola-free, but that does not mean the crisis is over\n\nMost popular Washington Post health stories of 2015: A mother tells her story of how she lost her darling daughter a few weeks short of her 29th birthday when she stepped in front of a train in Baltimore.\n\nTop health issues to pay attention to in 2016: The rise of personalized diets and medical treatments\n\nFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "While the story could have been a bit more specific, it gets points for stating that most ACE inhibitor drugs, and many ARB drugs, are now available in generic form, which means the cost for the medications would usually be considerably less than their comparative name-brand compounds.

blood testing of female adolescents for iron deficiency within a few years of starting menses, according to two studies by Penn State College of Medicine researchers.\n\nThe researchers used data from more than 6,000 women 12 to 49 years old who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2003 and 2010. As part of the survey, female participants had blood testing for iron deficiency as well as hemoglobin testing to identify anemia.\n\nWomen are typically tested some time in their teens for anemia -- the severe form of iron deficiency -- using a quick and affordable hemoglobin test. However, iron deficiency can develop years before anemia and can be missed by hemoglobin testing alone.\n\n\"If you think about your car, you have to run your gas tank all the way down before the red light goes on, and that's similar to the way we're screening for iron deficiency,\" said Deepa L. Sekhar, physician and associate professor of pediatrics. \"We're basically waiting until their red light goes on. You have to be really low on your iron storage before you're going to flag as anemic.\"\n\nIron deficiency without anemia has been associated with lower standardized math scores, attention deficit disorder and restless leg syndrome in children and adolescents. Among iron-deficient adolescent women there is a future risk of maternal iron deficiency and negative effects on infant health.\n\nBlood tests for iron deficiency without anemia have been developed but they are more costly and difficult to obtain in the doctor's office compared to hemoglobin testing for anemia. Sekhar and colleagues hoped to determine risk factors for iron deficiency without anemia that could pinpoint which women could benefit most from this more costly testing.\n\nIn the first study, when the researchers analyzed the NHANES study data, 9 percent of females who were 12 to 21 years old had iron deficiency without anemia. The researchers then looked at potential iron deficiency risk factors in this group, including the age when they started menstruating, as well as their race and ethnicity, poverty status, food insecurity, tobacco or nicotine use, dietary information, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity.\n\nAll of these factors have been associated with iron deficiency anemia in women in prior studies. However, the only risk factor significantly associated with iron deficiency without anemia in young women in this study was having had a period for more than three years. The research was recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nIn a second study, the researchers next looked at whether a specially developed questionnaire could better predict iron status. Questions were included on depression, poor attention and daytime sleepiness, symptoms which all have been associated with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia, but were not captured in the prior NHANES analyses. This questionnaire was compared to the currently recommended four iron deficiency anemia-risk questions in the Bright Futures Adolescent Previsit Questionnaire, a survey recommended for physician use by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nNinety-six female adolescents participated in this study, published in The Journal of Pediatrics. The Bright Futures questions alone did not predict iron deficiency or anemia. Yet, the researchers' risk assessment questionnaire was equally poor.\n\nTaken together, the studies suggest that risk factors and assessments should not be used to determine which young women should receive testing for iron deficiency.\n\n\"The questions aren't predictive,\" Sekhar said. \"I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia.\"\n\nSekhar believes the appropriate age may be 16 years old, when most females will have been menstruating for at least three years.\n\nIn addition to timing, further research will be needed to determine which blood test for iron deficiency without anemia is accurate, cost-efficient and practical for routine doctor's office use. This test should be given with hemoglobin testing to catch all young women on the spectrum of iron deficiency, Sekhar said.\n\nIron deficiency can be corrected with dietary changes and supplementation, Sekhar added.\n\nOther researchers on the study in PLOS ONE were Laura E.

seminar in Manhattan. There, they received a coupon for the latest in fertility management: a genetic test marketed as a way to help maximize their chances of becoming pregnant.\n\nThe hitch: Top reproductive endocrinologists point out that there\u2019s no evidence the $950 DNA test can actually help women conceive. And even the company\u2019s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can\u2019t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they\u2019re struggling with infertility.\n\nThe Fertilome test hit the market at the start of this year and the company behind it, Celmatix, said more than 50 doctors have already ordered it for hundreds of women seeking scientific guidance on questions such as whether they should freeze their eggs for future use, or whether it\u2019s worth it to try another round of in vitro fertilization. The Celmatix CEO, Piraye Yurttas Beim, said her team has heard of a small wave of \u201cFertilome babies\u201d on the way.\n\nSome reproductive specialists are enthusiastic. But others caution that Fertilome is just the latest genetic test promising more than it can deliver \u2014 and, in this case, playing to the fears of women who are anxious about becoming a mother. (Another example: a new $89 test that claims to tell women how their DNA could influence the level of a beneficial fatty acid in their breast milk.)\n\nThe Fertilome test, which must be ordered by a doctor, analyzes a woman\u2019s DNA for 49 genetic variants that have been linked to various conditions that can sometimes cause fertility problems. A couple weeks later, the doctor gets back a long report listing the odds that a patient has certain conditions.\n\nFor example, she might be 4.4 times more likely than women without a particular genetic variant to have a condition known as primary ovarian insufficiency, characterized by irregular periods and diminished fertility before age 40.\n\nThat sounds alarming, and might prompt a younger woman who\u2019s planning to delay pregnancy to freeze her eggs to be sure she has them available down the road. But the report does not explain that the condition is fairly rare \u2014 affecting just 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 and 1 in 250 women by age 35 \u2014 so the absolute risk is still very small.\n\nAnd just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn\u2019t mean they actually have it.\n\nMany of the other conditions that the test screens for are also quite rare. But the report doesn\u2019t explain the prevalence.\n\nSo a patient may see a table showing that her genetic variants make her twice as likely to have a condition known as recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as repeated miscarriages. But the report doesn\u2019t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. The doctor ordering the test, or a genetic counselor, is supposed to provide that information.\n\nWithout the proper context, \u201csome of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients,\u201d said Dr. John Petrozza, chief of the division of reproductive medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nPetrozza said he worries that women might wrongly interpret a long litany of genetic risks to mean that their hopes to start a family are \u201cdoomed.\u201d He also said he sees the test as \u201cvery costly for what it\u2019s trying to do \u2014 and not really giving, at least at this point, what I would consider meaningful information.\u201d\n\nThe Fertilome test was eight years in the making. It draws on more than 5,000 studies that have found associations between particular genetic variants and conditions that can cause fertility problems, company spokeswoman Colleen McMillen said.\n\nBeim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing \u201ctremendous\u201d value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a \u201ctiebreaker\u201d to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize.\n\n\u201cIt will help save a lot of heartache and time if we could know from the very beginning that [a given patient] is at risk for a uterine factor, or if it\u2019s more her eggs,\u201d said Dr. Angie Beltsos, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in Chicago who ordered the Fertilome test for one of her patients for the first time last month.\n\nWhat the test can\u2019t do: provide evidence-backed answers on what patients should try next. Nor can it tell patients whether they\u2019re wired to get pregnant from IVF \u2014 or wired to fail it. \u201cWe\u2019re not there. We\u2019re not claiming we\u2019re there,\u201d Beim said.\n\nBeim trained as a molecular genetics researcher. As a Ph.D. student at Weill Cornell in the 2000s, she worked on an early project in what\u2019s now called precision medicine: identifying the specific genetic alterations in the tumors of lung cancer patients that seemed to predict whether they would respond to a certain drug.\n\nAfter shifting her research focus to embryology, Beim found herself frustrated that the fertility field wasn\u2019t benefiting from the same boom in translational genetics that was reshaping oncology. So she started her own company.\n\nCelmatix also sells software, called Polaris, that pulls from the medical histories of hundreds of thousands of women to try to predict which fertility treatments are likely to work in different circumstances.\n\nFertilome \u2014 not to be confused with a line of weed killers and other gardening products with the same name \u2014 launched in January with a $1,900 price tag. Insurers don\u2019t cover it; after it became clear that patients were balking at the bill, Celmatix cut the price in half.\n\nCelmatix is mostly marketing the test to reproductive specialists, who are largely using it in the toughest infertility cases, Beim said.\n\nBut the company is also beginning to market directly to women \u2014 including younger women who aren\u2019t trying to get pregnant yet.\n\nThe company has recently started promoting social media ads, like one that asks: \u201cAre you getting the right fertility treatments for your DNA?\u201d Another asserts: \u201cOver 60% of millennial women are open to #eggfreezing. The Fertilome test can help you decide if it is right for you.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s website also features testimonials from women who say they have used Fertilome to help guide their decisions. There\u2019s Ella, a 30-year-old with dark hair and stylish clothing who decided to freeze her eggs after taking the Fertilome test. Then there\u2019s Maxine, a 27-year-old medical school graduate with short hair and a warm smile who used the test to help her juggle the timing of starting a family and starting her career.\n\nThe wrinkle: The images of Ella and Maxine are actually stock photos, available for purchase online.\n\nAfter questions from STAT, the company added a disclaimer acknowledging that testimonials are not quite as they were promoted from the start: the names, images, and details of patients\u2019 stories have been changed to safeguard their privacy.\n\nAlong with its social media outreach, Celmatix has held several after-work events for New York City-area women. It hosted one, on a Wednesday night in April, in its offices on Wall Street.\n\nAnd on a Tuesday evening earlier this summer, the company partnered with a women\u2019s group to host a conversation about \u201cproactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.\u201d Appetizers, wine, and beer were served \u2014 and, in a gesture to the crowd full of women with pregnancy on their minds, non-alcoholic beverages were on the menu, too.\n\nThe company is also trying to reach OB-GYNs whose patients aren\u2019t yet trying to get pregnant \u2014 or may be just beginning to try. Celmatix held webinars earlier this summer for OB-GYNs, telling them that the test could help \u201coptimize management plans from the very start.\u201d\n\nDr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in the Bay Area, is among a few doctors who\u2019ve been given vouchers by the company to offer the test for $500. She\u2019s been ordering the Fertilome test for her patients about five times a week.\n\nEyvazzadeh said the test recently helped her counsel a patient to forgo a third round of IVF, because the patient had a genetic profile that suggested it would be unlikely to work and wasn\u2019t in a financial position to gamble on such slim odds. (A round of IVF can cost $13,000.) That patient is now considering an egg donor.\n\nAnother one of Eyvazzadeh\u2019s patients is 31-year-old Tara Smith.\n\nFor Smith, who works as a foster parent providing intensive care in Northern California, there\u2019s nothing more important than family. She\u2019s dreamed of having her own baby since she was a child herself.\n\nThat\u2019s why Smith and her husband have spent about $70,000 over the past four years trying, without success, to get pregnant. They\u2019ve seen doctors in St. Louis and Las Vegas, taken countless blood tests, and tried two rounds of IVF and several cycles of intrauterine insemination. Smith has long known that she has a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, which can make it harder to get pregnant, but no one could figure out exactly why none of the treatments were working.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gut-wrenching. You\u2019re almost like this alien,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNobody knows what\u2019s going on, and you can\u2019t fix the problem.\u201d\n\nSo when Eyvazzadeh suggested that she take the Fertilome test, Smith jumped at the possibility of finally getting answers. Eyvazzadeh walked her through the results last month before showing her the report, so Smith had an idea of what to expect. Still, Smith said, \u201cmy heart sank\u201d when she saw her results for the first time.\n\nShe was 2.88 times more likely to have endometriosis, a painful disorder of the uterus, than a woman without a certain genetic variant. She was 1.54 times more likely to have primary ovarian insufficiency. She also carried three genetic variants that elevated her risk of having recurrent pregnancy loss. And she had 24 additional genetic variants that are more weakly associated with various conditions that can play a role in fertility problems.\n\nDespite it all, Eyvazzadeh had a plan. Because many of Smith\u2019s genetic variants were involved in immune response regulation, she instructed Smith to focus on minimizing inflammation.\n\nAt Eyvazzadeh\u2019s recommendation, Smith spent about $200 buying dietary supplements like fish oils, turmeric, cayenne pepper, resveratrol, and berberine from Amazon and Walmart. Smith also embarked on a new diet, cutting out dairy and red meat. (A 2015 review of the evidence on the optimal diet to promote fertility \u2014 and the utility of supplements \u2014 found the data \u201cconflicting.\u201d)\n\nThey also plan to have Smith get infusions of intralipids \u2014 a cocktail of soy bean oil, egg yolks, and other fatty acids \u2014 during her third round of IVF, which she\u2019s embarking on now. (Intralipid infusions are increasingly popular, but the practice was found not to help in a 2016 study of older women with a history of miscarriage.)\n\nSmith has mostly positive feelings about her Fertilome test. Having a concrete plan based on what\u2019s in her DNA gives her a new sense of hope. \u201cNow I feel like we\u2019re armed with information,\u201d she said. But at the same time, she said, knowing what may be wrong with her makes her apprehensive about whether she\u2019ll ever get pregnant.\n\nAfter all, so far, the test has pointed her only to try nutritional tweaks of uncertain value. It doesn\u2019t offer any definitive answers.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what gives Dr. Valerie Baker pause. A reproductive endocrinologist at Stanford, she recently suggested the test to a patient with longstanding infertility. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Baker recalled responding. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t do anything differently.\u201d\n\nShe did not end up ordering the test.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Cost\u2014since the test is not covered by insurance\u2014gets a prominent spot in this story.

But the report doesn\u2019t explain the prevalence.", "So a patient may see a table showing that her genetic variants make her twice as likely to have a condition known as recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as repeated miscarriages.

\u201ccolonoscopy\u201d \u2014 the unpleasant cleanse, the snakelike scope, the wobbly ride home. It\u2019s a process that\u2019s undeniably inconvenient, yet one we\u2019re told is unquestionably necessary.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame. Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it\u2019s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. And the drawbacks of colonoscopy \u2014 including the time commitment, not-so-fun preparation, expense and small chance of harm \u2014 are probably keeping some people from participating in colorectal cancer screening.\n\nAccording to public health experts, that\u2019s a bad thing. The United States Preventive Services Task Force says the net benefit for screening adults age 50-75 is \u201csubstantial,\u201d adding that colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the country. But as of 2012, just 65 percent of eligible adults were being screened as recommended, and almost 28 percent had never been screened.\n\nAmong those who are screened, colonoscopy is by far the most popular method in the U.S. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies \u2014 and they\u2019re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF\u2019s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. The group said that while some tests are backed by more evidence than others, it found no head-to-head studies suggesting any strategy \u2014 including colonoscopy \u2014 is better than another. \u201cChoose the one that fits your preferences and lifestyle,\u201d said Douglas Owens, a physician and member of the task force.\n\nIncluded on the list are two cheap, at-home poop tests intended to be done annually: the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and a more sensitive test called the fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. Both look for tiny amounts of blood in the stool that might be shed by cancer or polyps. You get one from your doctor, take a poop sample at home, and then return the sample to the doctor. Only if you get a positive result do you need to have a colonoscopy. (These are different from a new stool-based DNA test, which while on the USPSTF\u2019s list is much more expensive and has been studied less.)\n\nOf the two, Richard Wender, a physician and chief cancer control officer of the American Cancer Society, said the FIT is preferable, both because it\u2019s more accurate and because it requires only one poop sample and no changes in diet. It costs about $25 or less and when done every year, the USPSTF\u2019s models estimate, it will avert 20-23 deaths from colorectal cancer per 1,000 people screened. (Wender doesn\u2019t recommend the OTC tests that are available.)\n\nThat\u2019s comparable to the two \u201cscope\u201d tests on the USPSTF\u2019s list, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, which have the advantage of both detecting and removing precancerous polyps in one procedure. (Flexible sigmoidoscopy, which looks at the lower part of the large intestine, has been shown by randomized trials to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer but isn\u2019t reimbursed as well as colonoscopy and is on the decline in the U.S.)\n\nColonoscopy is the most popular test in the U.S. In addition to its polyp-removing ability, if you have a negative test, you don\u2019t have to come back for another 10 years. There is indirect evidence it reduces colorectal cancer deaths, in the form of a large study following people who did and didn\u2019t get the test over time. And it seems logical that if sigmoidoscopy cuts colorectal cancer deaths, the more extensive colonoscopy must provide a similar benefit. But that\u2019s not yet been proved by randomized controlled trials. Based on the available evidence and its modeling, the USPSTF estimates it reduces deaths from colorectal cancer by 22-24 per 1,000 people screened.\n\nBut that lack of trial data is why the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care earlier this year recommended against using colonoscopy as a first-line screening method. \u201cThey were very clear: We\u2019re going to stick to the evidence, and right now we don\u2019t have evidence for colonoscopy,\u201d said Aasma Shaukat, section chief of gastroenterology in the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.\n\nColonoscopy also has plenty of downsides.

At least that's what his mother, Glenda Beckham, said.\n\nPriddy is a 17-year-old junior at Stratford High School. He plays trombone and drums for the school band. In his spare time, he recently built a robot with a team of fellow students. His team won the International Rookie All-Star Award at an April robotics competition in Georgia.\n\nPriddy is proud of that achievement, but he is even prouder of something that many youths his age would take for granted: the ability to hear the announcer call his team's name at the awards ceremony. Just two years ago, he feared he might not hear anything again.\n\nToday, Priddy has cochlear implants in both ears and hears rain, birds and the wheels of a shopping basket screeching against the floor in the grocery store. These things are music to his ears.\n\nPriddy was born prematurely and had several lung surgeries before he was 4 years old.\n\n\"They told me that, if he lived, he would be totally deaf and totally blind,\u201d Beckham said. Her son never went blind, but his hearing steadily declined. By the time he was 14, he had lost about 70 percent of his hearing and was wearing hearing aids in both ears.\n\nEven with his hearing loss, Priddy was an excellent student, a gifted musician and well-liked among his classmates.\n\n\"He could always function despite his hearing problems,\u201d said Bill Naberhaus, one of Priddy's high school teachers.\n\nNaberhaus also suffered from extreme hearing loss, a result of long-term exposure to loud noises. \"I was notorious for being the hard-of-hearing teacher, the butt of many jokes,\u201d he said. \"But I didn't need to hear perfectly to be a good teacher.\u201d\n\nIt was when Priddy's hearing started a rapid decline his freshman year that he decided to visit Dr. Wayne Berryhill, a neurotologist at OU Physicians who specializes in cochlear implants. Berryhill explained how the implants function and their possible risks.\n\nAccording to Cochlear.com, the implant works by picking up sound through tiny microphones on a sound processor and converting the sound into digital signals.\n\nThe implant uses those signals to stimulate hearing nerves in the inner ear and replicate the sound.\n\nOnce the internal device is surgically implanted, the patient has to wait four to six week to heal before the device is turned on. It is then that the patient will either hear sounds or not.\n\nBerryhill said the cost of the implant and surgery is in excess of $60,000, but it is covered by most insurance companies as well as Medicare and Medicaid. He warns people that there is a risk the implant will not work and that they may need to have it replaced if it stops working. But the risks are low, he said, and most people who are good candidates for the implant will react positively to it.\n\n\"I was still scared to death,\u201d Priddy said. \"I had no idea what to expect.\u201d\n\nDespite his fears, within a few weeks, Priddy was in the operating room, nervously anticipating the implant surgery on his right ear.\n\nAfter the surgery, Priddy awoke and could hear nothing with his right ear.\n\n\"Right then, I thought, \u2018Oh, why did I do this?'\u201d he said. \"I wasn't even really worried about the deafness because it was hurting so bad. The pain was so excruciating at that moment.\u201d\n\nBut the deafness typically results after the device is implanted because it has yet to be turned on.\n\nWhen Priddy's implant was turned on six weeks later, he couldn't decipher the sounds he was hearing, but he was definitely hearing them.\n\n\"The first things that you hear are random little noises, buzzing, like you would hear from a computer when you get a cell phone close to it,\u201d he said. \"Eventually, the sound literally meshed together and started sounding like the teacher from \u2018Charlie Brown' \u2014 \u2018wah wah wah wah.'\u201d\n\nBecause the sounds generated by cochlear implants are different from sounds received naturally by the ear, it takes time to learn to interpret what they mean. But within a month or so, things started clearing up, and over the course of the next year, Priddy adapted to the implant.\n\nEventually, he decided to get another cochlear implant in his left ear. He was nervous about this because, being left-handed, he favors his left ear and was worried that he wouldn't be able to do one of his favorite pastimes: talking on the telephone. (To girls, late at night, his mother jokingly said.)\n\nBut Priddy adapted quickly to his second implant and can now talk on the telephone all he wants.

Women on the placebo also improved over time, however.\n\nThe findings come from the same clinical trial that, last year, showed Lexapro halved the number of hot flashes women had each day. (See Reuters story of January 18, 2011.)\n\nA separate study a few months later showed no such benefit, however. In two trials of 36 women, researchers found that Lexapro did not cut the number or severity of hot flashes over eight weeks. (See Reuters Health story of May 26, 2011.)\n\nAnd the lead researcher on that study said these latest findings are \u201cnothing to write home about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe differences between the treatment and placebo groups are very small,\u201d said Robert Freedman, a professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University in Detroit.\n\nIn general, studies of hot-flash remedies over the years have \u201cvirtually always found a large placebo effect,\u201d Freedman noted in an interview.\n\nThat could mean that study participants\u2019 hot flashes are just getting better over time, which they sometimes do.\n\n\u201cBut my feeling is that it\u2019s the placebo effect,\u201d Freedman said, referring to the phenomenon of study participants on placebos improving because they believe they are getting a real treatment.\n\nHot flashes, which mostly affect women transitioning to menopause and already in that phase of life, involve a sudden sensation of heat, sometimes accompanied by sweating or visible reddening of the skin.\n\nTheir exact cause is unknown, but hormonal regulation of body temperature is thought to be involved.\n\nBouts of hot flashes can happen many times a day and past research has found they can continue for anywhere from a few months to up to 10 years.\n\nSo far, Freedman noted, the only hot-flash treatment that has consistently worked in studies is hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\n\nAnd right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes.\n\nBut women and doctors are wary of HRT these days \u2014 since a 2002 clinical trial linked the hormones to increased risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots.\n\nSo researchers have been looking for alternatives. And studies have suggested that a few antidepressants, used at low doses, can be helpful for some women \u2014 including paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac) and venlafaxine (Effexor).\n\nThis latest study, reported in the journal Fertility & Sterility, focused on hot flash \u201cinterference\u201d \u2014 the degree to which women feel hot flashes disrupt their lives.\n\nThat\u2019s important because it gets at quality of life, according to the researchers, led by Janet S.

The new drink, called Souvenaid, may actually stimulate the growth of new synapses, said the drink's inventor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Dr. Richard Wurtman.\n\nBut more research is needed before the drink could be made available to the public. And, even then, consumers should exercise caution, said William Thies, vice president for medical and scientific affairs at the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nNutricia, a division of Dannon, sponsored the study. MIT has a patent on Souvenaid, and Nutricia has the exclusive license on the patent.\n\n\"Existing data now suggests that it may be possible to receive something that will sustain cognition in people with Alzheimer's disease with a limited concern about side effects,\" Wurtman said.\n\nPrevious experiments in animals showed that giving them the three compounds included in the drink increased the production of synapses improving brain function, he said.\n\nFor the new study, nearly 260 early Alzheimer's patients in Europe drank either Souvenaid or a placebo for six months.\n\nDuring the first three months of the study, patients in both groups showed improved memory. After that, however, patients taking the placebo had a decline in memory. In contrast, patients taking Souvenaid continued to show improved memory on tests used to assess Alzheimer's patients.\n\nWhether Souvenaid will slow the progression of Alzheimer's isn't known. There is, however, a longer trial going on that might answer that question, Wurtman said. \"I don't think it has any effect on the fundamental diseases process, but we'll see,\" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the July 10 online edition of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nThe drink combines three ingredients: choline, uridine and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nCholine is a B vitamin found in meats, nuts and eggs, and omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish, eggs, flaxseed and meat from grass-fed animals. Uridine, which is produced by the liver and kidneys, is also found in some foods as a part of RNA, which helps make protein in the body.\n\nThese nutrients, along with other proteins, are essential for making brain-cell membranes that form synapses. To be effective, all three compounds must be given together, the researchers said.\n\nNearly all patients drank the nutrient cocktail consistently throughout the study, and there were no serious side effects, the researchers reported.\n\nTo show the drink's effect on the brain, patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG) throughout the trial. During the study, the brains of those taking the drink shifted from patterns of dementia to more normal ones, the researchers found.\n\nSince EEG patterns reflect the activity of synapses, this result suggests that synaptic function increased with treatment, the researchers said.\n\nAn earlier study found that patients with more advanced Alzheimer's did not benefit from Souvenaid, most likely because brains cells had already been lost so new synapses couldn't develop, Wurtman said.\n\nThere are as yet no plans to market Souvenaid, so the cost hasn't been established, company spokesman William Green said.\n\n\"Souvenaid is a test product in development, which is still undergoing clinical trials,\" Green said. \"No plans for the introduction of Souvenaid to the market -- either in Europe or the U.S. -- have been confirmed.

Polyps this size are considered pre-cancers and most likely to progress to cancer, Ahlquist said.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test is much better than what has been seen in other stool screening tests, the ACS' Brooks added. \"But, showing that in a small group of samples is very different from demonstrating that in a population where only a small number of individuals are going to have polyps of that size.

Savings over time on a more accurate test done fewer times could justify the higher cost of the Cologuard test, Ahlquist said.\n\nIn two other presentations at the meeting, researchers have linked key gene variants to the risk for colon cancer and also to the prognosis of the disease.\n\nIn one study, researchers found that people who have long telomeres, the small strips of DNA that cover the ends of chromosomes, have a 30 percent increased risk of developing colon cancer.\n\n\"Even for people their age, their telomeres were longer than you'd expect for healthy people,\" lead researcher Dr. Lisa A. Boardman, an associate professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, said in a statement. \"This suggests that there may be two different mechanisms that affect telomere length and that set up susceptibility to cancer,\" she said.\n\nIn the other study, a research team led by Kim M. Smits, a molecular biologist and epidemiologist in the GROW-School for Oncology and Developmental Biology at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, uncovered a surprise when it came to a gene variant on the KRAS gene called the G variant. This variant, long linked to poorer outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer, actually predicted a better prognosis in early-stage colon cancer.\n\n\"You would intuitively think that the G variant would be associated with a poorer prognosis, as it is in late-stage colorectal cancer, but that is not the case,\" Smits said in a statement.\n\nExperts point out that studies presented at scientific meetings do not have to pass the rigorous peer review of studies published in reputable journals.\n\nFor more information on colon cancer, visit the American Cancer Society.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "A hesitant satisfactory score.\u00a0 The story stated, \u201cthe cost of the test has not yet been established.

In just five days, all 18 people fully recovered. This small but stunningly successful trial offers hope to address the growing problem of drug-resistant malaria.\n\nDetails of the cases are documented in the paper \"Artemisia annua dried leaf tablets treated malaria resistant to ACT and i.v. artesunate: case reports\" by an international team lead by Pamela Weathers, PhD, professor of biology and biotechnology at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), who has pioneered the use of dried leaves of Artemisia annua (DLA) as a malaria therapy.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first report of dried-leaf Artemisia annua controlling ACT-resistant malaria in humans,\" the authors of the Phytomedicine paper note, adding that more comprehensive clinical trials on patients with drug-resistant malaria are warranted. \"Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa,\" they added, \"and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged.\"\n\nWatch a video about research at WPI related to this study.\n\nThe report documents the experiences of 18 patients in the North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo who showed symptoms of malaria and were originally treated with the recommended medication: artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which blends artemisinin, a chemical extract from Artemisia annua, with one or more other drugs that attack the malaria parasite in different ways.\n\nThe 18 patients, ranging in age from 14 months to 60 years, did not respond to the standard ACT treatment, and all lapsed into severe malaria, defined by symptoms that can include loss of consciousness, respiratory distress, convulsions, and pulmonary edema. One patient, a five-year-old child, became comatose. All were then treated with intravenously administered artesunate, the frontline medication for severe malaria, but again they showed no improvement.\n\nAs a last resort, doctors turned to dried-leaf Artemisia (DLA), a therapy developed and extensively studied by Weathers and her team at WPI. After five days of treatment with tablets made from only the dried and powered leaves of Artemisia (which has been prepared and analyzed using methods developed by Weathers and postdoctoral fellow Melissa Towler), all 18 patients fully recovered. Laboratory tests showed they had no parasites remaining in their blood. (Weathers noted more than 100 other drug-resistant patients also have been successfully treated with DLA tablets.)\n\n\"These 18 patients were dying,\" Weathers said. \"So to see 100 percent recover, even the child who had lapsed into a coma, was just amazing. It's a small study, but the results are powerful.\"\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 212 million people contracted malaria in 2015 and some 429,000 died, with young children and pregnant women being particularly vulnerable. Caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, the illness is reported in nearly 100 countries and threatens nearly half of the world's population. ACT, the current recommended therapy, is expensive to produce and is in short supply in areas hit hardest by the disease. In addition, while the combination therapy is designed to be less prone to the drug resistance that has rendered previous antimalarial agents ineffective, increasingly the malaria parasite is showing signs of resistance to ACT, particularly in Southeast Asia.\n\nWeathers began her research on artemisinin and Artemesia annua (also known as sweet wormwood) more than 25 years ago. In recent years, she has turned her attention to the use of DLA as an alternative to conventional antimalarial drugs. Noting that Artemisia annua, which is classified as a generally regarded as safe (GRAS) herb, has been consumed by humans and used as an herbal therapy for thousands of years, often in the form of a tea, she became intrigued by the potential for using the dried plant, rather than just a chemical extract, as a malaria treatment. A study she published in Photochemistry Reviews in 2011 was the first to demonstrate that dried leaves of the Artemisia annua plant delivers 40 times more artemisinin to the blood than does the drug based on the chemical extract of the plant.\n\nIn a paper published in PLOS ONE the following year, Weathers and her team showed that not only does DLA have antimalarial properties, it is more effective in knocking out the parasite and reduced the level of parasite infection more completely in mice. In a 2015 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the WPI researchers, with colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, showed that dried Artemisia leaves cured rodents infected with malaria strains that were known to be resistant to artemisinin. And, in an experiment that accelerated the evolution of the malaria parasite by passing it through up to 49 generations of mice, the parasite showed no signs of resistance to DLA.\n\nWeathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plant's leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs.\n\n\"We have done a lot of work to understand the biochemistry of these compounds, which include a number of flavonoids and terpenes, so we can better understand the role they play in the pharmacological activity of the dried leaves,\" Weathers said. \"The more we learn, the more excited we become about the potential for DLA to be the medication of choice for combatting malaria worldwide. Artemisia annua is known to be efficacious against a range of other diseases, including other tropical maladies and certain cancers, so in our lab we are already at work investigating the effectiveness of DLA with other diseases.\"\n\nAnother advantage of DLA over conventional malaria treatments is its low cost and the relative simplicity of its manufacture, Weathers said. While the processes for manufacturing ACT is costlier and requires a higher degree of expertise, producing DLA tablets can be accomplished with simpler equipment and a modest amount of training. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy.\n\nIn fact, she has already established a supply chain in Africa that includes growing and harvesting high-producing cultivars in East Africa, along with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) processing operations in Uganda where the leaves are dried, pulverized, and homogenized, where the powder is compacted into tablets, and where the tablets are tested to verify their dosage. This supply chain helped produce the tablets used to treat the 18 patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \"This simple technology can be owned, operated, and distributed by Africans for Africans,\" Weathers said.\n\nFounded in 1865 in Worcester, Mass., WPI is one of the nation's first engineering and technology universities.

(HealthDay News) -- Adding computer-aided detection to mammograms finds more early, noninvasive cancers and helps detect invasive cancers at earlier stages, according to a large new study. But the jury's still out as to how worthwhile the extra technology is overall.\n\nFor one thing, computer-aided detection (CAD) increases the amount of diagnostic testing among women who turn out not to have breast cancer. And the technology makes mammograms more expensive.\n\nCAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. \"It's an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms,\" he said.\n\nComputer-aided detection systems use a digitized mammogram image from either a traditional film mammogram or a digitally acquired mammogram, according to the American College of Radiology. The CAD software looks for areas that may indicate cancer so the radiologist can then look more closely at the mammogram.\n\nAlthough it has rapidly become part of mammogram screening, Fenton said there is limited and conflicting research on its effect.\n\nUnder Medicare payment rates, doctors get an additional $11 for adding computer-aided detection to a mammogram, said Fenton, citing Medicare data. The Medicare rate for a film mammogram is $81 while a digital mammogram is $139.\n\nHis team evaluated more than 409,000 mammograms -- with and without computer-aided detection -- from more than 163,000 women aged 67 to 89. The study is published in the April 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nFenton took data from a large U.S. epidemiology database from 2001 to 2006. During that time, computer-aided detection use increased from 3.6 percent to 60.5 percent. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said.\n\n\"In our study, we assessed its impact in the Medicare program,\" he said. The researchers compared the results when mammograms included CAD to when they did not.\n\nWhen computer-aided detection was used, doctors found a greater number of early cancers known as ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. \"But the [overall] rate of invasive breast cancer diagnosis was no different with or without CAD,\" Fenton said.\n\nHowever, among the women who did have invasive cancer, computer-aided detection was linked with a greater likelihood of finding the cancer while it was stage 1 or 2 compared to stage 3 or 4, they found.\n\n\"CAD was also associated with increased diagnostic testing among women who turned out not to have breast cancer,\" he said. These women, because breast cancer was suspected, had to be called back for additional tests, such as repeat mammograms or biopsies.\n\nSo is the new computer technology worth it? \"Our study doesn't answer that question; it raises that question,\" Fenton said. The findings, he said, are a mix of potential good news and not so good. The additional tests that turn out to be unnecessary, because no cancer is found, are not desirable, he said.\n\nSome of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. But doctors can't say with certainty which ones will progress and which ones will not.\n\n\"Women should recognize that CAD comes with some potential risks,\" Fenton said. \"It has the potential risk of a false-positive mammogram. If you are an older woman, [there is] the risk of overtreatment of noninvasive lesions.\"\n\nDr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations.

Although the treatment of DCIS is debated among experts, Kopans said, \"In my mind, it is always worth it to find additional cancers.\"\n\nOne limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference.

They reported this screening approach detected high-risk HPV in all of the cases of women who were found to have high-grade, abnormal cervical precancerous growths, showing that self-collection at home for HPV may be a viable method to identify women at high-risk for cervical cancer.\n\n\"This is a demonstration that mailing self-collection kits and returning them to test for high-risk HPV infection has big potential to increase screening access among under-screened women, and to do that successfully,\" said UNC Lineberger's Jennifer S. Smith, the study's senior author, and a professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nAlthough cervical cancer is preventable through early detection and treatment, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 4,100 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States this year. Nearly 20 percent of women in the United States who are eligible for cervical cancer screening report they haven't been tested for cervical cancer within the recommended time interval, national surveys have shown.\n\n\"Women are dying unnecessarily of cervical cancer because they either haven't been vaccinated against HPV in adolescence, or they've not been getting screened according to national guidelines,\" Smith said. \"Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance.\"\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed off on using an HPV test alone to screen for cervical cancer for women 25 years and older, in conjunction with the Pap test.

Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.\n\n\u201cThis study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,\u201d Elias said. \u201cFor the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.\u201d\n\nPioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.\n\nSeventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)\n\nParticipants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months. Participants reported major improvements in their quality of life. People who couldn\u2019t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so.\n\nParticipants who received the sham procedure, on the other hand, showed no significant improvements.\n\n\u201cThe degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study, but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life \u2013 that\u2019s what patients really care about,\u201d Elias said.\n\nThe most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face; in most instances, these side effects were temporary but some were permanent.\n\nFDA Approved Based on the clinical trial led by Elias, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the focused ultrasound device, manufactured by InSightec Inc., for the treatment of essential tremor. The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients\u2019 tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.\n\nThe FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it\u2019s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months. The cost at UVA has not yet been determined.\n\nPeople interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealth.com/focusedultrasound. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available.\n\nThe procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. It can\u2019t be used in patients who cannot undergo MRI imaging, including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker. It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues.

But there's a catch often not understood by those who undergo the procedure: Once they lose the weight the surgery helps them lose, there may be more surgery to come -- surgery that is costlier and riskier and that requires a longer recovery time than the original operation.\n\nThe reason: excess skin. An obese person who loses weight quickly will lose the fat but not the skin that once enveloped the fat. The arms, thighs, abdomen, breasts, all lose texture and sag.\n\n\"It's as if a very, very large person all of a sudden had all the air let out, as if [he] were a doll,\" says Richard A. D'Amico, chief of the Department of Plastic Surgery at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in Englewood, N.J.\n\nThe solution: plastic surgery to remove the extra skin, a set of procedures known as body contouring.\n\nAs bariatric surgery has grown more common (some 144,000 such procedures were performed in the United States in 2004, more than double the number in 2002), D'Amico says, patients seeking body contouring have \"started to show up in plastic surgeons' offices in large numbers.\" Last year more than 68,000 patients underwent body contouring after bariatric surgery, 77 percent more than five years ago, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nBarbara Baez of Fort Worth was part of that increase. Within a year of having weight loss surgery in 2003, she lost about 150 pounds; her blood pressure dropped to normal levels and the swelling in her legs decreased. She felt healthier and began exercising more. Friends told her she looked great. But, she says, \"nobody saw what was underneath.\"\n\nHer abdomen drooped so much that it got the way of her workouts. \"Exercise was a problem because you have this bouncing skin, and it's uncomfortable.\"\n\nIntense discomfort that interferes with activity is a common problem after bariatric surgery, says plastic surgeon Sarah Holland, an instructor at Columbia University Medical Center in New York -- and it can be almost constant. The skin, she says, \"has been irreparably damaged by the stretch [and it] doesn't shrink down like the rest of the body does. So it just hangs.\" In addition, she says, \"Their clothes don't fit very well because there's no place to put the extra skin.\"\n\nMany patients get chronic infections from skin rubbing against skin, and develop open wounds in the folds of flesh.\n\nFrom the skin rubbing together against her thighs, she developed bacterial and fungal infections. \"I would have bandages on me all the time. It was very painful. Just walking was painful. I had hygiene problems.\" Eventually, Baez says, \"I realized that I would need to have the skin removed.\"\n\nHer doctors never warned her this might be necessary, she says. That's not uncommon, says D'Amico. There are no guidelines requiring bariatric surgeons to warn their patients, although recently professional societies of plastic surgeons and bariatric surgeons have begun holding seminars to discuss the idea.\n\nBaez waited about a year before she started searching for a plastic surgeon. That should be the norm, says Holland. Patients should be at a stable weight for at least a month, she adds, to make sure that they've \"lost all the weight they're going to lose.\"\n\nWhile the surgical techniques used in contouring operations have been around for decades, bariatric patients present \"a unique challenge\" to plastic surgeons, says D'Amico. \"Contouring the low abdomen in somebody who has lost 250 pounds is a bigger technical effort than doing a tummy tuck on a 130-pound woman who's just had a couple of pregnancies.\"\n\nBody contouring operations are often longer and more complex than bariatric surgery, involving potentially more blood loss and shifts of fluids, and a painful healing period that can extend over weeks or months. Like all major surgery, it also carries risks of infection and problems with anesthesia.\n\n\"It's a radical procedure,\" warns Baez, who had her contouring work done last August. \"It was much more invasive than my initial surgery.\"\n\nThe American Society of Plastic Surgery (ASPS) has formed a task force -- D'Amico is a co-chair -- to alert doctors to the higher risks involved and teach them new techniques. \"It's been a hot topic at all the national conferences over the last couple of years,\" says Holland.\n\nSome body contouring patients may require several procedures -- one for the thighs, one for the arms and so on. To manage pain and prevent long periods under anesthesia, most patients have the procedures done in stages over a series of weeks or months.\n\nBecause the surgery is still relatively new, there are few studies of complication rates. A small study published in January in the Annals of Plastic Surgery showed 27 percent of patients in one practice had complications including wound infections, fluid collections called seromas, collections of blood under the skin called hematomas and death of fat cells. To help prevent seromas, special tubes are left inside the body, connected to small plastic drains on the outside. The tubes may have to remain in place for as long as three weeks.\n\nSome contouring doesn't work so well the first time around. Gavin Dry, a Seattle plastic surgeon wrote last month in a Plastic Surgery newsletter, \"I have seen a dramatic increase in the number of [surgical] revisions required by massive-weight-loss patients.\" He blamed the rise in do-over surgeries on increased demand for body contouring procedures and surgeons who \"lack adequate experience.\"\n\nBody contouring also leaves long, visible scars: hip to hip, knee to groin, elbow to armpit. \"There's no way to cut out skin without leaving a scar,\" Holland says. \"We can work on improving the scars, improving healing, but we can't eliminate the scars.\"\n\nAfter a long and painful recovery, Baez was left with what she describes as \"huge scars\" on her thighs, extending from \"three inches above the knee all the way to the groin, underneath the buttocks, and the front as well.\" It's a trade-off, she says. \"You trade the scars for the better quality of life.\"\n\nBaez says she couldn't appreciate how much skin was removed from her thighs because, even weeks after the surgery, the scars were \"so red, so puffy -- it was not a pretty outcome.\"\n\nThe cost of contouring can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, depending on how many procedures are needed. Most insurers pay for bariatric surgery, but they often consider contouring to be cosmetic, rather than medically necessary, and thus not covered under their policies.\n\n\"We spend ridiculous amounts of time trying to get this surgery approved by insurance companies,\" says Holland. Only about 25 percent of the cases her department submits get approved.\n\nBaez was initially turned down by her insurer, despite her recurrent infections and open wounds. Baez appealed. \"I knew I had a medical problem,\" she says, along with plenty of pictures to prove it and a thick medical file. Ultimately, she won her case. \"Be prepared for a battle,\" she advises, and \"document, document, document.\"\n\nSeven weeks after surgery, Baez concluded the pain and effort had been worth the result: an end to the recurrent skin infections in her thighs and abdominal folds. Six months out, she remains pleased with her flatter stomach and her better quality of life. She still recalls her reaction when her doctor showed her before-and-after pictures and photos of the skin that had been removed from her stomach. \"Did I really have that much skin?\" \u00b7\n\nRanit Mishori, a family medicine resident at Georgetown University/Providence Hospital, wrote recently for the Health section about the growth in the use of cochlear implants.

contouring operations have been around for decades, bariatric patients present \"a unique challenge\" to plastic surgeons, says D'Amico.", "\"Contouring the low abdomen in somebody who has lost 250 pounds is a bigger technical effort than doing a tummy tuck on a 130-pound woman who's just had a couple of pregnancies.\"", "Body contouring operations are often longer and more complex than bariatric surgery, involving potentially more blood loss and shifts of fluids, and a painful healing period that can extend over weeks or months.", "Like all major surgery, it also carries risks of infection and problems with anesthesia.", "\"It's a radical procedure,\" warns Baez, who had her contouring work done last August.", "\"It was much more invasive than my initial surgery.\"", "The American Society of Plastic Surgery (ASPS) has formed a task force -- D'Amico is a co-chair -- to alert doctors to the higher risks involved and teach them new techniques.", "\"It's been a hot topic

Topical treatments are available for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but there has a lack of long-term follow-up data to guide treatment decisions. A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n\nMore than 80% of all skin cancers are BCC, arising from the basal cells (i.e., small, round cells found in the lower layer of the epidermis). There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. The prognosis is excellent, but it can cause significant disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues.\n\nWhile most types of BCC require surgery, superficial BCC can be treated topically with noninvasive treatments such as PDT, imiquimod cream, fluorouracil cream, cryosurgery or electrodessication and curettage.\n\nInvestigators in the Netherlands report the results of a three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that compared three noninvasive treatments that included imiquimod and fluorouracil cream. \"The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams,\" explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \"Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices.\"\n\nHowever, prior to this study there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up that compare the effectiveness of noninvasive treatments. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC.\n\nA total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream. The three study groups had a similar distribution of baseline characteristics, with the exception of tumor size.\n\nAround 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.\n\n\"Based on our findings, both imiquimod and fluorouracil are effective noninvasive treatments in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, but the data provide no definite evidence for superiority of imiquimod to fluorouracil,\" commented Dr. Roozeboom. \"Both creams have an equal cosmetic outcome and risk of local adverse events. Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod. However, between one- and three-year follow-up, more recurrences were diagnosed in the fluorouracil group compared with the imiquimod group.\"\n\n\"When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account. For example, we have found that in superficial BCC on the lower extremities in older patients, PDT should be prescribed rather than imiquimod. Our evidence indicates that a personalized treatment approach is necessary,\" added Dr. Roozeboom.\n\n\"Three year follow-up results of photodynamic therapy versus imiquimod versus fluorouracil for treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma: a single blind, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial,\" by Marieke H.

Topical treatments are available for superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but there has a lack of long-term follow-up data to guide treatment decisions. A three-year randomized controlled clinical trial has found that two topical creams are effective in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, comparing favorably with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as reported by investigators in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.", "More than 80% of all skin cancers are BCC, arising from the basal cells (i.e., small, round cells found in the lower layer of the epidermis). There are over two million cases a year in the U.S. and the lifetime risk of developing a BCC before the age of 85 years is one in five people. The prognosis is excellent, but it can cause significant disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues.", "While most types of BCC require surgery, superficial BCC can be treated topically with noninvasive treatments such as PDT, imiquimod cream, fluorouracil cream, cryosurgery or electrodessication and curettage.", "Investigators in the Netherlands report the results of a three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial that compared three noninvasive treatments that included imiquimod and fluorouracil cream. \"The main advantages of noninvasive treatments are good cosmetic outcome, preservation of surrounding tissue, and potential for home application of either creams,\" explained lead investigator Marieke Roozeboom of the Department of Dermatology, Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \"Throughout the last two decades there has been a growing interest in these non-surgical therapies, which offer the possibility of avoiding surgery and reducing demands on busy medical practices.\"", "However, prior to this study there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials with a long-term follow-up that compare the effectiveness of noninvasive treatments. Consequently, there is no consensus in international BCC guidelines on the first choice of noninvasive therapy for superficial BCC.", "A total of 601 patients with a superficial BCC participated in this study: 202 patients were treated with methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), 198 with imiquimod cream, and 201 with fluorouracil cream. The three study groups had a similar distribution of baseline characteristics, with the exception of tumor size.", "Around 80% of patients with superficial BCC were tumor free after imiquimod treatment after three years. The clearance rate was 68% for patients treated with fluorouracil and 58% for individuals receiving PDT.", "\"Based on our findings, both imiquimod and fluorouracil are effective noninvasive treatments in most primary, low-risk superficial BCC, but the data provide no definite evidence for superiority of imiquimod to fluorouracil,\" commented Dr. Roozeboom. \"Both creams have an equal cosmetic outcome and risk of local adverse events. Fluorouracil has the advantage of being less expensive than imiquimod. However, between one- and three-year follow-up, more recurrences were diagnosed in the fluorouracil group compared with the imiquimod group.\"", "\"When choosing a treatment for an individual patient with a superficial BCC, other factors like age, compliance, and patient preferences should always be taken into account.

supposed to zero in on colon growths better than an older version known as guaiac FOBT \u2014 which often picked up bleeding originating in the upper digestive tract, such as from a stomach ulcer.", "Immunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test.", "But there\u2019s been surprisingly little evidence that it really is highly \u201cspecific\u201d to colon cancer, according to Dr. Yi-Chia Lee of National Taiwan University Hospital, one of the researchers on the new study.", "So for their study, the researchers followed nearly 2,800 adults who all volunteered to have iFOBT, a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy to check for problems in the upper digestive tract.", "They found that of 28 people confirmed to have colon tumors after a colonoscopy, all but one had also a positive iFOBT result.", "\u201cIt means that almost every case with colon cancer can be identified by iFOBT,\u201d Lee told Reuters Health in an email.", "\u201cIt is a strong support to iFOBT as an effective screening tool.\u201d", "The researchers also found that iFOBT had \u201cspecificity\u201d for colon cancer of close to 90 percent, meaning the test would accurately give a negative result to almost 90 percent of people who did not have colon cancer.", "Of three study participants who were found to have cancers of the stomach or esophagus, for instance, none had a positive result on the iFOBT test.", "Like any screening test, iFOBT does have a risk of false-positive results, which leads to unnecessary invasive testing in some people.", "In this study, about 10 percent of all participants had a false-positive finding on the stool test.", "Among the risk factors for false-positives the authors identified were the use of anticlotting drugs and low levels of the iron-rich molecule hemoglobin in the blood.", "In practice, a positive iFOBT result would be followed by colonoscopy, in which a scope is used to investigate the interior of the colon.", "Whether used for first-line screening or as a follow-up, colonoscopy has the advantage of allowing doctors to spot and remove pre-cancerous growths called polyps \u2014 which means the test can prevent cases of colon cancer.", "But as far as cutting the risk of death from colon cancer, stool testing is similarly effective, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.", "And it\u2019s much cheaper: iFOBT is more expensive than the older stool tests, but it is still roughly $30.", "A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.", "The downside of iFOBT being specific to colon tumors is that it is not useful for catching cancers of the stomach or throat.", "That\u2019s particularly important in Asia, where those cancers are common.", "Lee said researchers there are looking into whether combining iFOBT with the older guaiac test is useful for catching cancers in the lower and upper digestive tract \u2014 and whether adding a third stool test, which looks for the ulcer-causing bacteria H. pylori, can help as well.", "Infection with H. pylori is associated with increased risks of stomach and throat cancers.", "In the U.S., cancers of the upper digestive tract are relatively uncommon.",

Winer, chief of women\u2019s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.\n\nTamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.\n\nAbout 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.\n\nIn the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.\n\nAbout 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.\n\nThere was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.\n\nWhether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cThe treatment effect is real, but it\u2019s modest,\u201d said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nTamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.\n\nSome 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.\n\n\u201cOver all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,\u201d Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t feel well on them, but it\u2019s their safety net,\u201d said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. \u201cI have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.\u201d\n\nEmily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. \u201cIf it can keep the cancer away, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.\n\nCost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.\n\nThe results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.\n\nPerhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.\n\nPostmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.\n\nMr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would \u201capply to endocrine therapy in general,\u201d meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years. Other doctors were not so sure.\n\nThe Atlas study was paid for by various organizations including the United States Army, the British government and AstraZeneca, which makes the brand-name version of tamoxifen.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "Clearly stated.", "answer": 1, "paragraphs": ["Dr. Eric P.

The problem is that all too often, no one knows what is normal.\n\n\u201cA patient comes in because he\u2019s in pain,\u201d said Dr. Nelda Wray, a senior research scientist at the Methodist Institute for Technology in Houston. \u201cWe see something in a scan, and we assume causation. But we have no idea of the prevalence of the abnormality in routine populations.\u201d\n\nNow, as more and more people have scans for everything from headaches to foot aches, more are left in a medical lurch, or with unnecessary or sometimes even harmful treatments, including surgery.\n\n\u201cEvery time we get a new technology that provides insights into structures we didn\u2019t encounter before, we end up saying, \u2018Oh, my God, look at all those abnormalities.\u2019 They might be dangerous,\u201d said Dr. David Felson, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University Medical School. \u201cSome are, some aren\u2019t, but it ends up leading to a lot of care that\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d\n\nThat was what almost happened with Mrs. Weinstein, an active, athletic 64-year-old who lives in New London, N.H. And it was her great fortune to finally visit a surgeon who told her so. He told her bluntly that her pain was caused by arthritis, not the torn cartilage.\n\nNo one had told her that before, Mrs. Weinstein said, and looking back on her quest to get a scan and get the cartilage fixed, she shook her head in dismay. There\u2019s no surgical procedure short of a knee replacement that will help, and she\u2019s not ready for a knee replacement.\n\n\u201cI feel that I have come full circle,\u201d she said. \u201cI will cope on my own with this knee.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mrs. Weinstein was also lucky because her problem was with her knee. It\u2019s one of only two body parts \u2014 the other is the back \u2014 where there are good data on abnormalities that turn up in people who feel just fine, indicating that the abnormalities may not be so abnormal after all.\n\nBut even the data on knees comes from just one study, and researchers say the problem is far from fixed. It is difficult to conduct scans on people who feel fine \u2014 most do not want to spend time in an M.R.I. machine, and CT scans require that people be exposed to radiation. But that leaves patients and doctors in an untenable situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Jarvik, a professor of radiology and neurosurgery at the University of Washington. \u201cWe are trying to fix things that shouldn\u2019t be fixed.\u201d\n\nAs a rheumatologist, Dr. Felson saw patient after patient with knee pain, many of whom had already had scans. And he was becoming concerned about their findings.\n\nOften, a scan would show that a person with arthritis had a torn meniscus, cartilage that stabilizes the knee. And often the result was surgery \u2014 orthopedic surgeons do more meniscus surgery than any other operation. But, Dr. Felson wondered, was the torn cartilage an injury causing pain or was the arthritis causing pain and the tear a consequence of arthritis?\n\nThat led Dr. Felson and his colleagues to do the first and so far the only large study of knees, asking what is normal. It involved M.R.I. scans on 991 people ages 50 to 90. Some had knee pain, others did not.\n\nOn Sept. 11, Dr. Felson and his colleagues published their results in The New England Journal of Medicine: meniscal tears were just as common in people with knee arthritis who did not complain of pain as they were in people with knee arthritis who did have pain. They tended to occur along with arthritis and were a part of the disease process itself. And so repairing the tears would not eliminate the pain.\n\n\u201cThe rule is, as you get older, you will get a meniscal tear,\u201d Dr. Felson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a function of aging and disease. If you are a 60-year-old guy, the chance that you have a meniscal tear is 40 percent.\u201d\n\nIt is a result that paralleled what spine researchers found over the past decade in what is perhaps the best evidence on what shows up on scans of healthy people. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to look at a spine, you need to know what that spine might look like in a normal patient,\u201d said Dr. Michael Modic, chairman of the Neurological Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAfter Dr. Modic and others scanned hundreds of asymptomatic people, they learned abnormalities were common.\n\n\u201cSomewhere between 20 and 25 percent of people who climb into a scanner will have a herniated disk,\u201d Dr. Modic said. As many as 60 percent of healthy adults with no back pain, he said, have degenerative changes in their spines.\n\nThose findings made Dr. Modic ask: Why do a scan in the first place? There are some who may benefit from surgery, but does it make sense to routinely do scans for nearly everyone with back pain? After all, one-third of herniated disks disappear on their own in six weeks, and two-thirds in six months.\n\nAnd surgeons use symptoms and a physical examination to identify patients who would be helped by operations. What extra medical help does a scan provide? So Dr. Modic did another study, this time with 250 patients. All had M.R.I. scans when they first arrived complaining of back pain or shooting pains down their leg, which can be caused by a herniated disc pressing on a nerve in the spine. And all had scans again six weeks later. Sixty percent had herniated disks, the scans showed.\n\nDr. Modic gave the results to only half of the patients and their doctors \u2014 the others had no idea what the M.R.I.\u2019s revealed. Dr. Modic knew, though.\n\nIn 13 percent of the patients, the second scan showed that the herniated disk had become bigger or a new herniated disk had appeared. In 15 percent, the herniated disk had disappeared. But there was no relationship between the scan findings at six weeks and patients\u2019 symptoms. Some continued to complain of pain even though their herniated disk had disappeared; others said they felt better even though their herniation had grown bigger.\n\nThe question, though, was whether it helped the patients and their doctors to know what the M.R.I.\u2019s had found. And the answer, Dr. Modic reported, is that it did not. The patients who knew recovered no faster than those who did not know. However, Dr. Modic said, there was one effect of being told \u2014 patients felt worse about themselves when they knew they had a bulging disk.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you that you have a degenerated disk, basically I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re ugly,\u201d Dr. Modic said.\n\nScans, he said, are presurgical tools, not screening tools. A scan can help a surgeon before he or she operates, but it does not help with a diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIf a patient has back or leg pain, they should be treated conservatively for at least eight weeks,\u201d Dr. Modic said, meaning that they take pain relievers and go about their normal lives. \u201cThen you should do imaging only if you are going to do surgery.\u201d\n\nThat message can be a hard sell, he acknowledged. \u201cA lot of people are driven by wanting to have imaging,\u201d Dr. Modic said. \u201cThey are miserable as hell, they can\u2019t work, they can\u2019t sit. We look at you and say, \u2018We think you have a herniated disk. We say the natural history is that you will get better. You should go through six to eight weeks of conservative management.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt the Partners Healthcare System in Boston, spine experts have the same struggle to convince patients that an M.R.I. scan is not necessarily desirable, said Dr. Scott Gazelle, director of radiology there.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is that you are a surgical candidate or not based on your history and physical findings, not on imaging findings,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Gazelle had a chance last year to test his own convictions. He had the classic symptoms of a herniated disk \u2014 shooting pains down his left leg, a numb foot and difficulty walking.\n\nDr. Gazelle went to see his primary-care doctor but, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get an M.R.I.\u201d That decision, he added, \u201cwas the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAbout three months later, he had recovered on his own.\n\nIn 1998, two medical scientists, writing in The Lancet, proposed what sounded like a radical idea. Instead of simply providing patients and their doctors with the results of an X-ray or an M.R.I. scan, he said, radiologists should put the findings in context. For example, they wrote, if a scan showed advanced disk deterioration, the report should say, \u201cRoughly 40 percent of patients with this finding do not have back pain so the finding may be unrelated.\u201d\n\nIt is an idea that only would work for back pain, because that is the one area where radiologists have enough data. But it made eminent sense to Dr. Jarvik. \u201cIt gives referring physicians some sort of context,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, a few years ago, with some trepidation, his radiology group starting including epidemiological data in their reports. \u201cWe thought, \u2018What\u2019s going to be the reaction among referring physicians?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Jarvik said. Their fear was that doctors would start choosing other places for M.R.I.\u2019s and that Dr. Jarvik\u2019s group would lose business.\n\nBecause of the way the university\u2019s records are kept, it\u2019s hard to know whether the new reporting system had that effect, Dr. Jarvik said. But he was heartened by the responses of some doctors, like Dr. Sohail Mirza, who recently moved to Dartmouth Medical School.\n\n\u201cWe often see patients who have already had M.R.I. scans,\u201d Dr. Mirza said. \u201cThey are fixated on the abnormality and come to a surgeon to try to get the abnormality fixed.

{"article": "TRENTON, N.J. \u2014 Cardboard boxes certainly aren\u2019t new technology. But when they\u2019re linked to a practice that started in Finland decades ago to help babies sleep safely, they\u2019re taking on a new purpose as so-called baby boxes make their way to the U.S.\n\nParents are beginning to take baby boxes home from hospitals along with their newborns. A Los Angeles-based company has partnered with health officials to give the boxes away for free and an online initiative offers advice aimed at reducing sudden unexpected infant deaths. New Jersey and Ohio were the first to participate statewide in the program.\n\n\u2018\u2018To new moms: (SUID) was one of my biggest fears and then it happened,\u2019\u2019 said 35-year-old Chauntia Williams, of Maple Heights, Ohio.\n\nWilliams is an advocate for safe sleeping and the boxes after she unexpectedly lost her 33-day-old daughter Aaliyah nine years ago. Williams said her daughter went to sleep in a crib with cushiony bumpers, stuffed animals and an added blanket beneath the fitted sheet and never woke up. She said the coroner determined the bedding caused the death.\n\nShe now uses a box with her son, Bryce, though he\u2019s getting a little too big for it. Her message to new parents: Educate yourselves on safe sleep habits.\n\n\u2018\u2018Open your mouth and say I\u2019m concerned about this so you can get the assistance,\u2019\u2019 Williams said.\n\nSudden unexpected infant death is a broad category that includes sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation that could come from overcrowded bassinets or cribs. The boxes aren\u2019t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they\u2019re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.\n\nOhio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.\n\nThe Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.\u2019s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.\n\nThe idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey\u2019s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.\n\nThe boxes are a new idea for many Americans.\n\n\u2018\u2018The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like \u2018wow that\u2019s weird,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.\n\nPeterson\u2019s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.\n\nMcCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don\u2019t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants\u2019 sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.\n\n\u2018\u2018No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it\u2019s not safe.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz. Parents can then take their digital or printed-out certificates to a participating hospital for their boxes.

Here was a simple, inexpensive do-it-yourself way for women to find tumors before it was too late. During the women's health movement of the 1970s, the self-exam gained importance as a means for women to take charge and rely less on a paternalistic health system. But researchers have learned that self-exams aren't at all simple. The technique is complicated and difficult to learn to do well. Guidelines on how to do them correctly have evolved, leaving many women and doctors with outdated ideas. Further, decades of research still have not produced good evidence that self-exams make any difference in breast cancer survival. \"Not only do the trials not find a benefit, the trials demonstrate harm in terms of increased physician visits and benign breast biopsies,\" said Dr. Nancy Baxter, a University of Toronto surgeon who reviewed the evidence on self-exams for the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. She said self-exams may not reveal tumors early enough to improve survival. \"By the time a breast cancer is large enough to be detected by self-exam, tumor biology is the most important predictor of outcome, not finding a tumor a few months before it would have become apparent,\" she said.

She stopped routinely teaching self-exams to patients after the large trials in China and Russia showed no benefit.\n\nSome evidence does suggest that self-exams done properly could make a difference. For instance, they provide a means to search for tumors in outer parts of the breast where mammography may not reach. About half of breast cancers develop in the upper-outer quadrant of the breast, which is largely inaccessible to mammography scanners. A small study in Canada in 1997 found that self-exams seemed to improve survival among a subset of women using proper technique. The preferred method, known as the vertical strip, three-pressure test, has proved the most sensitive and least likely to produce false alarms, Steiner said. In the largest and most influential study to date, involving 266,000 women in Shanghai, Steiner said researchers taught an inferior method of exams. She said that could partly explain why the Shanghai study failed to find improved survival. Self-exams also appeal strongly to some younger women, whose main screening test is a manual exam done by a doctor or nurse. Mammography is considered inappropriate for women younger than 40, and many doctors don't recommend it until age 50. If a woman decides to do self-exams, Steiner said, it's important to learn to do them right -- and do them every month without fail. \"Done haphazardly and irregularly, it is probably worse than no breast self-exam at all,\" Steiner said. She encourages women to schedule an appointment devoted to learning the technique, which should take at least a half-hour. A few minutes squeezed into a routine annual exam aren't enough, she said. Steiner said not all doctors are up to speed on breast exam technique, which calls for lying down, not taking a few minutes standing in the shower -- the form pushed for years by physicians and even anti-breast cancer groups. \"It's important to ask, 'Do you feel confident in your own technique and training me how to do it?'\" she said. Nelson cautions women not to skip their mammograms if they don't find lumps during self-exams. But finding a lump also is no reason to panic, given the limited accuracy of the self-test.

million Americans have sleep apnea, which causes repeated awakenings and pauses in breathing during the night, sometimes resulting in loud snoring and gasps for air. For decades, the standard treatment has been \u201ccontinuous positive airway pressure.\u201d A mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages, enabling easier breathing. C.P.A.P. reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea.\n\nBut the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive. Many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. Studies show that about half of all people prescribed C.P.A.P. machines stop using them in one to three weeks.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P. machine turns into a doorstop,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Golish, the former chief of sleep medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and now a professor with the MetroHealth System in Cleveland. \u201cC.P.A.P. is very effective in the sleep lab. But when people go home, there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t use it, and the success rate of an unused C.P.A.P. machine is absolutely zero.\u201d\n\nNow an alternative form of C.P.A.P. is gaining popularity: a patch that fits over the nostrils. Called Provent, the patch holds two small plugs, one for each nostril, that create just enough air pressure to keep the airways open at night. It is far less intrusive than the traditional C.P.A.P. machine. It is also more expensive, and it doesn\u2019t work for every patient.\n\nApproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008, Provent has spread mostly by word of mouth. But it has caught on fast. Its manufacturer, Ventus Medical, says it has shipped one million of the devices in the past 12 months, up from a half million total in the two years prior. Doctors say it has given them a new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea, and many patients who struggled with C.P.A.P. call it a godsend.\n\nBob Bleck, who owns a computer networking firm in Ohio, struggled with poor sleep and chronic fatigue for decades. But it was only a year and a half ago that he finally went to a sleep clinic, prodded by his wife, who worried about his heavy snoring.\n\nThe diagnosis was severe sleep apnea. Tests showed that in a typical night, Mr. Bleck, 47, awoke or stopped breathing 42 times an hour.\n\nHis doctor prescribed a C.P.A.P. machine, and Mr. Bleck hated it.\n\n\u201cI had this constricted feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be incorporated into these dreams where I was tied up, like in the movie \u2018Alien.\u2019 It was more difficult to sleep with that thing on than to just get through the night with the apnea.\u201d\n\nMr. Bleck got rid of the machine after he discovered Provent. \u201cAfter I started using it, I noticed a difference right away,\u201d he said. \u201cMy symptoms subsided dramatically.\u201d\n\nProvent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. machine but is only a fraction of the size. When people with apnea fall asleep, their throat muscles collapse, constricting the airway and causing the body to fight for air. C.P.A.P. machines use mild air pressure to keep the airway from constricting.\n\nProvent does too, but in a different way. The device contains two pinhole-size valves, one over each nostril. The valves let air in easily \u2014 most people breathe through their nostrils while asleep \u2014 but there is resistance as the user exhales. That resistance creates a backpressure in the airways, dilating the muscles that would otherwise collapse in the middle of the night. In the morning, the patch is removed; a new one is used every night.\n\nLast year, in a large study of 250 apnea sufferers published in the medical journal Sleep and subsidized by Ventus, researchers found that those who used Provent devices over a three-month period saw their apnea episodes fall sharply, compared with people who were given a sham, or placebo, device. A follow-up study tracked people over the course of a year and had similar results.\n\nBut not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In interviews, sleep specialists said that a third or more of patients do not end up using it.\n\n\u201cIt works like a champ in some people and doesn\u2019t work on other people,\u201d said Dr. Nancy Appelblatt, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Sacramento who has prescribed it to about 100 patients. \u201cAll sleep apnea is not created equal.\u201d\n\nSome people, for example, breathe through the mouth at night, not the nostrils. In those people, Provent typically doesn\u2019t work.

Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School and founder of the National Sleep Foundation.\n\nUnlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future. In the meantime, a 30-day supply of the patches costs $65 to $80.\n\nDr. Lee A.

But for the roughly 50 percent of patients in whom C.P.A.P. fails, Provent may be a reliable alternative.\n\nDr. Surkin said some patients use C.P.A.P. at home, but take their pocket-size Provent patches with them when they travel to avoid the hassle of lugging a machine through airports.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a miracle,\u201d said Joyce Nemoga, 64.

They hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places, such as schools, hospitals, and airports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a century that UV light is extremely efficient at killing microbes, bacteria, and viruses,\u201d says study leader David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. For that reason, UV devices are often used for sterilization \u2014 for medical equipment in hospitals, for example, or drinking water for backcountry campers.\n\nBut conventional germicidal lamps aren\u2019t safe for humans to be around. With prolonged exposure, they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes. \u201cSo up until now, they\u2019re only really practical when people aren\u2019t around,\u201d say Brenner. \u201cYou can sterilize a hospital room, but not when anyone\u2019s inside.\u201d\n\nAbout five years ago, Brenner says, the Columbia team came up with a potential solution. Light on the far end of the UV-C spectrum, known as far-UVC, has very short wavelengths. The researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses, but can\u2019t travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get all the benefits of UV light in terms of killing microbes, but none of the health hazards,\u201d says Brenner. Earlier studies, on animals and humans, have shown that exposure to far-UVC light does indeed appear to be safe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells, whereas with conventional UV light we\u2019ve always seen lots of biological damage,\u201d he says.

So sure is he of the science behind it that he frequently applies the stuff of his research on himself -- and on his wife.\n\n\"She had a persistent boil on her buttocks,\" he explained. Since no standard salves had helped, he liquefied a dollop of a particular variety of honey known as manuka in the kitchen microwave, poured it over gauze and applied it.\n\n\"Fortunately, manuka is effective in treating burns as well as boils,\" Molan said cheerfully. Within a short time, he said, both boil and burn healed.\n\nManuka honey -- widely used for wound treatment in New Zealand, where Molan is co-director of Waikato University's Honey Research Unit -- is becoming increasingly accepted for this purpose around the world. Research over the past two decades, much of it conducted in Molan's lab, has focused on the potential for manuka to be used as an antimicrobial that may one day stand alongside such standard wound treatments as silver dressings and penicillin.\n\nManuka has also attracted attention because, in an era when the efficacy of pharmaceutical antibiotics is under threat, it has shown some promise in the treatment of wounds infected with especially challenging bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the superbug whose incidence increased 32-fold in U.S. hospitals between 1976 and 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nManuka dressings have been in use for some time in Great Britain and Australia as well as in New Zealand; earlier this year they were cleared for use as an antimicrobial dressing in Canada; and last month the Food and Drug Administration cleared them for use in wound and burn care -- though not as an antimicrobial drug -- making them the first honey-based products cleared for medical use in the United States.\n\nThe picture has not always been so bright for manuka, or its manufacturers. New Zealand's scrubby manuka trees with their creamy blossoms used to be chopped down for farmland. Beekeepers regarded manuka honey as almost worthless, feeding it to their bees or simply discarding it: It was difficult to process, its taste too strong and bitter, its color too dark. In short, it seemed \"medicinal.\"\n\nThis began to change with Molan's work. He had spent his career examining the possible antibacterial properties of various natural substances: milk, yeast, bull semen. At a colleague's suggestion, he began looking into manuka honey, and for the past 25 years he has led the way in this particular aspect of apitherapy, the study of honey as a medicine.\n\nSurrounded by the pipettes and petri dishes of his lab, and with a strip of manuka dressing wrapped around a cut finger, Molan says, \"Manuka honey tastes like medicine because it is medicine.\"\n\nToday, New Zealand's Active Manuka Honey Association estimates that 120 tons are sold each year, with sales of almost $10 million annually. Manuka is proving to be a moneymaker for many companies that market it online as \"nature's miracle\" and \"nature's greatest secret,\" claiming it can relieve everything from stomach ulcers to bedsores and sinus infections. Although Molan says he has no direct financial interests in honey, the honey research unit was set up with support from New Zealand's Honey Industry Trust, and his work has resulted in his university's signing a multimillion-dollar contract last year with New Zealand health-care products company Comvita.\n\nAll honey is medicinal to some extent. Its low water content allows it to draw fluid away from wounds; its high sugar content makes it difficult for microorganisms to grow. What's more, worker bees secrete an enzyme, glucose oxidase, into nectar, which releases low levels of the disinfectant hydrogen peroxide when honey makes contact with a damp surface such as a wound. Because of a chemical reaction with tissue, honey also makes healing wounds smell good.\n\nFrom the time of the ancient Sumerians, who prescribed a mix of river dust and honey for ailing eyes, until the early 20th century, honey was a conventional therapy in fighting infection, but its popularity waned with the advent in the mid-20th century of a potent, naturally occurring antibiotic: the blue-green mold penicillin.\n\nNot all honeys are equal, though. Manuka appears to have a poorly understood antimicrobial ingredient, dubbed its Unique Manuka Factor (UMF). The level of UMF can vary, and each batch of manuka is ranked according to its UMF value: The higher the concentration, the darker, thicker and more expensive the manuka is. A 250-gram jar with UMF16, which is in the midrange, sells for about $28.95 on the Internet.\n\nAs with other natural health-care products, many of the claims for manuka's efficacy are sweeping and scantily supported. Molan distances himself from the notion, for example, that, once ingested, manuka acts as a rejuvenator. The most promising research, he and many other scientists say, focuses instead on bioactive honey's potency as a topical application.\n\nThe South African Medical Journal reported in 2006 on a trial among gold miners in which honey worked as well as, and was more cost-effective than, a standard gel on shallow wounds and abrasions.\n\nThe European Journal of Medical Research reported in 2003 that honey had an 85 percent success rate in treating infected post-op Caesarean wounds, compared with a 50 percent success rate for conventional interventions.\n\nOne reason for the heightened interest in honey is that traditional antibiotics are proving increasingly powerless against certain microbes. In 2000, a World Health Organization report warned: \"Since 1970, no new classes of antibacterials have been developed to combat infectious diseases.\" On average, the report said, \"research and development of anti-infective drugs takes 10 to 20 years.\" Today, according to the CDC, \"nearly all significant bacterial infections in the world are becoming resistant to the most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments.\"\n\nHence the hope that a naturally occurring substance such as honey might help fill the void.\n\nMolan offers anecdotal evidence from a ward at Waikato Hospital, where MRSA has been a persistent problem. The charge nurse, he says, began placing manuka on all wounds. \"Not only did manuka clear up the infections, there were no cross-infections,\" Molan says. \"Now, whenever MRSA appears at Waikato Hospital, they choose honey dressings.\"\n\nAt the May meeting of the European Wound Management Association, researchers presented the results of a small Irish study that compared the effects of manuka honey and a commonly used hydrogel dressing on 100 patients with chronic leg ulcerations. Those patients treated with manuka dressings experienced a higher rate of cleansing and faster healing than those who used the hydrogel dressing. Ten of the patients had ulcers colonized with MRSA. After four weeks, seven of those 10 wounds no longer showed the bacteria's presence. The results have not yet been published.\n\nEven scientists who are intrigued by manuka's promise recognize that more research needs to be done. (And there's wide agreement among medical professionals that people should not test the treatment themselves by slathering their cuts and burns with honey from the pantry shelf.)\n\nAndrew Jull, a research fellow at the University of Auckland's Clinical Trials Research Unit and principal investigator in a trial in New Zealand of 368 patients into the use of honey as a therapy for leg ulcers, says that while \"there is reasonable evidence for manuka honey's antibacterial effect\" in the lab, \"there is still need for in vivo testing.\"\n\nMolan suggests there may be another reason the United States has been slower than some other countries to adopt medicinal honey: the scientific establishment's resistance to traditional remedies.\n\nHe believes it's not customers or patients who need convincing, \"it's the medical community. They find it difficult to accept anything that has an ancient lineage, whatever the scientific evidence,\" he says. \"But manuka is catching on fast.\"\n\nSo much so that in July the FDA gave Derma Sciences, a manufacturer of wound-care products based in Princeton, N.J., clearance to sell manuka wound and burn dressings as medical devices. The company, which has been developing manuka products since 2005, buys medical-grade honey from Comvita, which receives unprocessed honey from beekeepers in New Zealand. The dressings should be available this fall.\n\nRose Cooper, a microbiologist and honey expert at the University of Wales Institute at Cardiff, remains cautiously optimistic that the increased use of honey dressings will help better information to emerge.\n\n\"Honey is not a panacea,\" she said in a telephone interview, but it has been used by British doctors for several years, and with its growing use elsewhere in the world, \"health-care professionals will be more likely to consider honey in treating wounds, and so more data will accumulate.\" \u00b7\n\nEric Frederick Trump is a science journalist and a research associate of the Trauma and Violence Interdisciplinary Studies Program at New York University.

\u2014 and often the only one \u2014 to be poked, prodded and analyzed, experts say. The burden of figuring out infertility is too often placed on the woman alone.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the majority of society looks at infertility as a women's issue, but that's just not the case,\" said Brad Imler, American Pregnancy Association president.\n\nPlaced among dozens of pregnancy, ovulation and female fertility kits, an at-home sperm test that hit retail shelves in April could help change that mentality, experts said.\n\nSpermCheck Fertility, which determines in minutes whether a man's sperm count is low, offers almost instant insight into one of the many aspects of male fertility. Although it's not a comprehensive evaluation and could give some consumers a false sense of security, the test does provide a starting point while drawing attention to male infertility as a legitimate health concern.\n\n\"It may provide (an opportunity for) both physicians and couples to take a closer look at ways for men to step up to the plate and optimize their reproductive potential,\" said Dr. Robert Brannigan, urologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \"I think anything that highlights the fact that men can have issues, that men do play a role in infertility, is important.\"\n\nApproximately 15 percent of U.S. couples of reproductive age who are trying to conceive face infertility issues, said Brannigan, an expert in male fertility.\n\nMale infertility contributes to 50 percent of those cases, he said. Male infertility alone is the cause 30 percent of the time; a combination of male and female factors account for the other 20 percent.\n\nSpermCheck Fertility is designed to help couples determine more quickly whether male infertility might be a problem for them, said Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, based in Charlottesville, Va. Many men put off having a semen analysis because they don't want to provide a sample in a doctor's office or lab, he said.\n\n\"No one wants to go through the embarrassment of jumping in that room and looking at dirty magazines,\" Lopez said.\n\nGiving men the opportunity to take a test in the privacy of their home helps get the process moving, he said.\n\nMen tend to think they're perfectly healthy, especially when it comes to their sexuality, APA's Imler said. This test, which is noninvasive, could be wake-up call for some.\n\n\"If there is a problem with him, it's identified a little quicker,\" Imler said. \"We love the idea of avoiding that heartache of that month to month struggle of trying to conceive without success.\"\n\nSpermCheck Fertility is the only FDA-approved home sperm test currently on the market and available in retail stores, Lopez said. The test costs about $40; the average cost of a semen analysis in a doctor's office is about $100.\n\nAt-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. Four years ago an FDA-approved home test called Fertell, which is no longer for sale, offered an evaluation of both male and female fertility.\n\nThere are also several at-home sperm analysis kits available online. They each include a microscope and cost at least $80.\n\nAlthough it's not the first ever at-home test, SpermCheck Fertility is the first one to use the lateral flow assay method, Lopez said. When the semen sample is applied to the test strip, the liquid works its way up the paper until it reaches the results window.\n\n\"It's very, very similar to a pregnancy test,\" Lopez said. \"The concept behind our test is to keep it simple, user friendly.\"\n\nFor Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she was surprised by the number of steps involved, although none were very difficult.\n\nScott, a \"mommy blogger\" who requested and received a free test to review, said she wanted her husband to take the test to see if a recent vasectomy had worked.

The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year.\n\n\u201cWe have unequivocal evidence and data that show better outcomes when we access the heart\u2019s coronary arteries and perform angioplasty through a blood vessel in the wrist rather than through the femoral artery in the groin,\u201d said first author Amit P.

Such symptoms suggest the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart are blocked or narrowed and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle is reduced. Interventional cardiologists insert a small tube into an artery in the wrist or the groin, which can be used to view the narrowed heart artery, deliver an inflatable balloon to open up the narrowed section, and possibly deliver a stent to hold the vessel open.\n\nUsing the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry, the researchers analyzed data from almost 280,000 Medicare patients who underwent PCI and were eligible for same-day discharge. Despite the fact that all of these patients were capable of leaving the hospital the same day as their procedures, only about 5 percent of these patients actually were discharged without having stayed overnight.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that it is very safe to send these patients home the same day,\u201d said Amin, who treats patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \u201cWe use risk-prediction models to predict their risks ahead of time, and we plan ahead to mitigate any issues so we can facilitate a same-day discharge. This is really about patient care. We want to outline health-care pathways that provide the best care for patients.\u201d\n\nThe analysis demonstrated an average cost of $13,389 for the wrist approach with same-day discharge, compared with $17,076 for the groin approach with at least one night of hospitalization, resulting in a cost savings of about $3,700 for outpatients who get the wrist-access procedure. Independent of the length of stay, the wrist approach costs about $900 less than the groin approach, on average.\n\nThe investigators estimated that if a hospital performing 1,000 of these procedures annually shifted 30 percent of these patients to the wrist-access with same-day discharge approach, the hospital would save $1 million over that period. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion.\n\nOf the study\u2019s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access. According to Amin, improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries, even for complex cases, and should be considered for more patients.\n\n\u201cThe traditional way has been to go through the bigger femoral artery that is a straight pathway to the heart,\u201d Amin said. \u201cUnfortunately, that artery is also deep.

Warfarin is notoriously tricky to modulate, however, and needs to be closely monitored -- usually through monthly doctors' visits. If the drug's activity isn't checked regularly it can trigger severe bleeding episodes, the most serious of which can happen in the brain.\n\n\"Warfarin is labor-intensive to manage,\" said study researcher Dr. Jack Ansell, chairman of the department of medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"Sometimes it impairs the patient's quality of life and the outcomes are very dependent on how well the drug dosing is managed,\" he added. \"This [new] drug has a lot of advantages over warfarin.\"\n\nWith apixaban, patients can use a standard dose that doesn't need monitoring and adjusting, Ansell said. Also, unlike warfarin, apixaban has few interactions with other drugs or foods, he added.\n\nThe study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the makers of apixaban.\n\nApixaban is a so-called Xa inhibitor, a class of anticoagulants (anti-clotting drugs) that work by blocking factor X, a protein involved in blood clotting. Ansell expects drugs in this class will have a major effect on how atrial fibrillation is managed in the future.\n\nAnother similar drug, Pradaxa (dabigatran), has been on the market for about a year and many patients with atrial fibrillation have been switched or started on it, he said.\n\n\"Once [apixaban] is available it is going to be very difficult to avoid offering this drug to patients,\" he said.\n\nThe issue of cost remains a factor, however. While generic warfarin is just pennies a dose, any new brand-name drug is likely to be much more expensive. According to Laura Hortas, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb, because apixaban is still an experimental drug its price tag remains uncertain.\n\nThe new report was published online Aug. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with its presentation at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Paris.\n\nFor the trial, more than 18,000 patients with atrial fibrillation and a heightened risk for stroke were randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or warfarin.\n\nOver an average of 1.8 years of follow-up there were fewer strokes or clots among patients taking apixaban (1.27 percent a year), compared with patients taking warfarin (1.6 percent per year), the researchers found.\n\nThis means that apixaban prevented six patients from having a stroke, 15 patients from having a major bleeding event and eight patients from dying, the researchers said in a Duke University news release.\n\nThe major effect on stroke was preventing hemorrhagic stroke, which is caused by bleeding in the brain and is the most serious type of stroke. According to the researchers, apixaban reduced this risk by 50 percent, preventing four patients from having this type of stroke and two patients from having an ischemic stroke (cause by a vessel blockage) or stroke of uncertain origin.\n\nAs to apixaban's expected higher price tag, Ansell said that since the drug does not require monitoring and the incidence of stroke and major bleeding are less, savings in doctors' visits and stroke treatment should more than compensate.\n\nThe new trial comes on the heels of another study on apixaban that was stopped early due to safety concerns. In that trial, published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine, apixaban's use was associated with raised odds for bleeding -- without providing patients with any reduction in heart attack risk.\n\nHowever, \"in that case, apixaban was given to patients with coronary artery disease who were also taking two other blood thinners,\" Ansell noted. \"The three of them together showed that the risk of bleeding was just too high and there was no real benefit in that population.

All for about four bucks a bottle.\n\nThose impressive claims helped the company rack up $91 million in sales in 2009. They also earned the disapproval of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Last month, the agency sued POM Wonderful for making \"false and unsubstantiated\" health claims, and is asking the company to remove the claims from its ads.\n\nA 100 percent juice drink that contains antioxidants (and no added sugar), POM is just one of many beverages that bill themselves as promoting better health. VitaminWater, kombucha tea, coconut water, and various brands of juice drinks made from acai, goji berry, and mangosteen have all used health claims in their marketing -- and some, like POM, have been the subject of scrutiny and legal action.\n\nThe FTC, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been cracking down on food and beverage makers for allegedly overselling the health benefits of their products. In 2009 alone, the FDA warned 17 companies that they were providing misleading nutritional information on their packaging or making overly specific health claims.\n\nHealth.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat\n\nNot all of the products were drinks, but \"the beverage category stands out,\" says Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. \"At first blush it seems that beverage products are certainly a large proportion of food products that make bogus health-related claims.\"\n\nDrinks such as POM have become increasingly popular with consumers in recent years, thanks in part to public health campaigns against soda that have been prompted by the obesity epidemic. \"The trend is away from traditional soda pop [toward] products claiming to provide magical health benefits,\" Silverglade says.\n\nAre the health claims true? Yes and no. The federal government doesn't require companies to vet health claims with the agency before plastering them on product packaging (as long as the claims are accompanied by a disclaimer about their uncertainty). But that doesn't mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research.\n\nThe research is often funded by the manufacturers, however, and industry-funded research can be prone to bias. A 2007 study found that research on health drinks that was funded entirely by beverage companies was between four and eight times more likely to find a favorable result than research with no industry support.\n\n\"If a cell phone company told you they tested all the models and their model came out the best, would you believe it? Probably not,\" says Dr. Lenard Lesser, M.D., one of the co-authors of that study and a researcher at UCLA. \"The same is true with nutrition research, but the stakes are higher because we're putting our bodies at risk.\"\n\nWhere's the line between research and marketing?\n\nHowever far-fetched the claims may sound, POM is standing behind them. (Two weeks before the FTC publicly announced its lawsuit, POM preemptively sued the FTC, claiming that preapproval of ads featuring health claims violates the company's right to free speech.)\n\nBut are shoppers really convinced that POM can unclog their arteries, cure cancer, and lead to hotter sex?\n\nThere seem to be more than a few believers out there. \"\n\nI started drinking POM after reading the studies two years ago, my triglycerides were almost 1000!,\" one of POM Wonderful's 12,000 fans breathlessly posted on Facebook after the FTC announced its lawsuit. \"Working out everyday, drinking POM, and eating healthy, they are now less than 400. Forget what the Feds say! I believe!!!\" (A triglycerides level of 400 is still nearly three times higher than what's considered normal.)\n\nMost health beverage drinkers aren't as enthusiastic as the realtor from Alaska who posted the above testimonial. Quinton Ma, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator at Gawker Media, in New York City, started to drink VitaminWater as a middle schooler because it seemed like a healthy alternative to soda.\n\n\"I figured that if they were selling something that I could get extra vitamins from, it couldn't hurt to drink,\" Ma says. \"Once I learned they were really just cleverly marketed sugar waters, I stopped.\"\n\nHealth.com: You are what you drink\n\nBut the fact is, even when people don't buy the health claims they often still buy the beverage. That's the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food.\n\nThat's because these claims -- however improbable they may seem -- distract shoppers from the real nutritional information and hook consumers with buzzwords like \"antioxidant.\"\n\nThis phenomenon is known as a \"health halo,\" an aura of healthfulness attached to a product based on labels like \"low-fat\" \"all-natural\" or \"made with whole grains\" that seduces consumers into overeating.

There he would inject himself with refrigerated blood-clotting factor to prevent internal bleeding and extensive bruising and swelling. \u201cI was walking on eggshells all the time,\u201d said the former aerospace engineer who has a blood disorder called hemophilia B.\n\nThen, last year, Konduros enrolled in a clinical trial, receiving an experimental gene therapy at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Almost immediately, he began producing the missing clotting factor. Several weeks later, after he dropped a heavy box on his shin, he watched a bruise develop and shrink within hours. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he thought. \u201cLife's easy if this is what happens.\u201d\n\nKonduros, 53, who runs a bakery and cafe in southeastern Ontario, is one of 10 men in an early-stage trial sponsored by Spark Therapeutics. (The disorder is much more common in men than women.) On Wednesday, researchers reported that a single intravenous infusion of Spark's novel gene therapy enabled patients to safely produce sufficient clotting factor to prevent dangerous bleeding episodes.\n\nThe treatment also \u201cnearly universally eliminated\u201d the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. And its effects lasted; after a year and a half, the longest patient follow-up, the therapy was continuing to work.\n\nThe results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent \u201canother example of the gene-therapy renaissance,\u201d Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. He said the data suggests that the treatment ultimately might provide an \u201cideal cure\u201d for hemophilia B.\n\nStill, he noted, the study has some limitations. The follow-up period was relatively short, from 28 to 78 weeks in the new report; longer-term studies are needed to prove safety and effectiveness over extended periods. In addition, he said, researchers need to find ways to provide the therapy to a broader group of people, including children, and to figure out how to reduce the costs involved.\n\nThe researchers presented earlier findings on the gene therapy a year ago at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting, but the latest data covers a larger patient group and a longer time period.\n\nThe hemophilia gene therapy is one of several being tested for conditions including sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease. The one-time treatments seek to fight the disease by adding correct copies of a patient's defective genes. If approved, such treatments are expected to command stratospheric prices. For example, a separate Spark gene therapy for a rare type of childhood blindness, which is on track for Food and Drug Administration clearance soon, could cost $1 million per patient for infusions in both eyes, according to some Wall Street analysts.\n\nStill, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings. Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions.\n\nOther experts also were impressed by the results. The hemophilia study \u201cis small but very promising, and it gives me the sense that gene therapy for hemophilia B is going to be at our disposal in no time, maybe a few years from now,\u201d said Aric Parnes, who is associate director of the Boston Hemophilia Center at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and wasn't involved in the study. \u201cOne of the key things is, how long will the treatment last?

The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople were planning their lives around hemophilia, and now they are doing activities that they weren't before,\u201d George said. \u201cOne man who came in a wheelchair is now out of a wheelchair and is coaching Little League.\u201d\n\nPeople with hemophilia B inherit a gene mutation on the X chromosome that interferes with their ability to produce normal levels of blood-clotting factor IX.

Bleeding episodes \u2014 which can result from injury or occur spontaneously \u2014 can cause extensive damage and be life threatening.\n\nThe therapy developed by Spark, a biotech company spun off from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2013, involves a bioengineered gene designed to prompt the body to produce increased levels of a different clotting factor. The gene is transported to the liver, where clotting factor is made, by a harmless virus called an adeno-associated viral vector. For the current trial, which is being funded by Spark and Pfizer, researchers used a clotting factor that is 8 to 10 times as strong as the normal version. The stronger factor is called Factor IX-Padua, because it was discovered in 2009 in an Italian family.\n\nPatients produced clotting-factor levels that were enough to allow blood to clot but not to spur an undesirable immune-system response, the researchers said.\n\nFDA advisers urge approval for first gene therapy for inherited disease\n\nIn a first, scientists edit genes inside a man's body to try to cure a disease.

It's necessary for strong bones, and Rosen is a leading bone specialist. So he was surprised recently when his wife's new physician thought she might be deficient in vitamin D.\n\n\"She's a runner. She's in great shape,\" Rosen says. \"She drinks dairy. She gets a lot of sun exposure.\" Sun exposure is key for vitamin D, known as the sunshine vitamin. When skin is exposed to sun, it makes vitamin D.\n\nStill, the doctor wanted to run a blood test to see if Rebecca Rosen had adequate vitamin D.\n\n\"So my wife said, 'Well, why do I need to have a vitamin D [test]?' And the physician said, 'Well, that's part of our measurement for wellness.' \"\n\nIt's not just Rebecca's doctor, and it's not just in Portland, Maine. Increasingly, doctors all over the country are convinced that checking patients' vitamin D levels is as important as monitoring their cholesterol.\n\nMedicare payments for vitamin D testing, at $40 a pop, nearly quadrupled between 2006 and 2008, to $129 million. A decade ago, Medicare payments were only about $1 million. The figures for 2009 and this year are bound to be higher.\n\n\"There's overwhelming evidence ... that increasing your vitamin D intake can make substantial improvement in your overall health and welfare,\" says Dr. Michael Holick of Boston University. \"And there is no downside to increasing your vitamin D intake. As a result I think that most people are now getting on the bandwagon.\"\n\nHolick is leading the band. Forty years ago, he discovered the active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. He has written several popular books on the subject and has another one, The Vitamin D Solution, coming out next month. Its cover calls vitamin D deficiency \"our most common health problem.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, everybody should be taking either a vitamin D supplement, take a prescription that the doctor recommends,\" Holick says. \"All adults should be taking at least 1,000 to 1,500 international units a day.\" Dietary intake, mainly through sources such as vitamin D-fortified dairy products and juice, may add up to 200 to 400 units a day.\n\nHolick is convinced that if people boost their vitamin D levels, they'll be substantially less likely to develop not only osteoporosis but also many types of cancer, heart attack, diabetes (both types), autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, autism, even tuberculosis and the flu.\n\nNot so fast, other experts say.\n\nDr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, points out that nearly all of the proliferating studies involving vitamin D are what scientists call \"observational.\" That is, they compare people with high and low levels of vitamin D and correlate those levels with whether or not the person has a disease.\n\nBut these studies, she points out, are fraught with possible error. People with higher vitamin D levels may be healthier because they exercise more, have better diets, are out in the sun more. Those who are sick may have low levels because they don't have those healthy habits.\n\n\"We don't yet have the large-scale, randomized clinical trials showing benefits in terms of prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, cognitive decline, depression, autoimmune disease,\" Manson says.\n\nManson and her colleagues are launching such a trial.

That same visit, the lightning pain going down his back went away, and he got up and walked out. That\u2019s amazing. By the fifth visit, he was completely out of pain,\u201d Fuh said.\n\nIn nonsurgical spinal decompression, a patient is placed on a special type of table with harnesses on the pelvis and rib cage. The back is gently stretched over a number of treatments, allowing the disc to rehydrate and heal.\n\nResearch has shown an 86 percent to 94 percent success rate with decompression. It is designed for patients who have not had surgery.\n\nThe treatment, which includes several 20-minute procedures and rehabilitation, costs between $3,500 and $4,000. It is less than half the cost of surgery but is rarely covered by insurance.\n\nThe idea is based on results from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Patients, who often are frail or live far from their doctors, can be spared frequent office visits. Doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients\u2019 hearts are starting to fail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week,\u201d said Dr. Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range, 20 or 30 feet.

More information, she warned, is not always beneficial.\n\nThe devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear, like variations in heart rate. Large swings in heart rate can indicate risk, but it is not clear what to do about them.\n\nEven more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance, a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung. Impedance changes can predict future heart crises, but more often have no clinical explanation. Yet when doctors get data on impedance changes, they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are, making patients uneasy in turn, Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nDr. Stevenson likened such information to the game of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d \u2014 doctors are given answers in search of a question. It\u2019s a challenge even for the nation\u2019s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition.\n\nDr. Richard Page, president of the Heart Rhythm Society, said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data. Still, he said, the new technology \u201cis potentially transformative.\u201d\n\nFor researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem: how to analyze the data. A large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve 1,000, maybe 2,000 patients. Now, Boston Scientific, a maker of one of the smart heart devices, is following 400,000 patients.\n\n\u201cNo one has ever done research like this before,\u201d said Dr. Saxon, who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing Boston Scientific research. The company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write, Dr. Saxon said.\n\nBoston Scientific gets data from patients\u2019 defibrillators. It also gets information on deaths from Medicare.\n\nThe data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed, a task requiring the company to become more like a Google or a Microsoft, handling enormous amounts of information. There are, for example, more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over 60,000 instances when the defibrillators went off, shocking a patient\u2019s heart.\n\nSo far, Dr. Saxon\u2019s group has reported on the first 90,000 patients. Half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group.\n\nPatients whose doctors looked at the data survived 5 to 15 percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices, Dr. Saxon reported. And, in a paper under review, the group reports that their three-year survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data.\n\nOther researchers will be analyzing economic data. The devices can cost as much as $30,000. Do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits?\n\nA study using a similar device, made by Medtronic, suggests that is the case. The Medtronic study, directed by Dr. George Crossley, president of St Thomas Heart at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, involved 2,000 patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor\u2019s offices every few months, the standard of care.\n\nPatients whose devices transmitted spent less time, on average, in the hospital when they were admitted \u2014 3.3 days compared with 4 days \u2014 and their hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission.\n\n\u201cThe plausible reason, we think, is that we got to these people much sooner in the course of their illness,\u201d Dr. Crossley said. \u201cWe think we did not let the people in the remote sensing group get into heart failure.\u201d\n\nStill, the information overload problem looms. One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data.\n\nThe idea, said Dr. Neal Eigler, a senior vice president at St. Jude, is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart\u2019s functioning, just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings.\n\nPatients hold a small device over their chest twice a day, and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath. It transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium \u2014 the upper left chamber of the heart. If pressure in that chamber gets too high, the lungs can fill with fluid.\n\nDoctors preprogram the hand-held device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements, telling them, for example, to take a different dose of a medication, restrict fluid intake, increase their activity level or call the clinic.\n\nIf successful, the smart device could have a big effect. One million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure. Ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs.\n\nDr. Stevenson, who has no connection with St. Jude, is intrigued. Patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly. They have to strictly limit salt in their diet, for example, and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating.\n\n\u201cA patient might say, \u2018Maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza I had for dinner last night had a lot of salt,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Stevenson said.\n\nAs a more positive incentive, the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well.\n\nSt. Jude recently completed a small study of 40 patients and is starting a large clinical trial. In the pilot study, the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by two-thirds and the number of hospitalizations by 80 percent over five months.\n\nMeanwhile, patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind.\n\nThey include people like Danielle Denlein, who, to her total shock, developed a serious heart problem.On October 20, 2008, at 1:50 p.m., Ms. Denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her 5-day-old baby girl. Suddenly, she felt a pain in her chest. She thought it was heartburn. Then it began radiating down her arm.\n\n\u201cI just knew \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I knew, but I knew \u2014 I was having a heart attack,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough she was only 35, her main coronary artery had ripped open, a rare complication associated with pregnancy.\n\nMs. Denlein now relies on her smart defibrillator to save her from her injured heart, and to alert her doctor, Dr. Saxon, to problems if they occur.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life changing,\u201d Ms. Denlein said. \u201cIt gives me such a feeling of comfort.\u201d\n\nMrs. Elzo feels the same way.\n\nHad her device not alerted her doctor that it needed to be replaced, she said, \u201cI shudder to think what would have happened.\u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "\u00a0Mixed bag.

of the syndrome in more than 60 percent of patients, researchers report. The first two drugs raise dopamine levels in the body, and the last two drugs reduce the amount of calcium reaching brain cells and trigger the production of other chemicals that help reduce pain. Dopamine is a brain chemical that regulates movement and mood.\n\n\"Physicians and patients now have better information on the effectiveness and harms of two types of drug treatments for patients with at least moderately severe restless legs symptoms in which to guide treatment choices,\" said review author Dr. Timothy Wilt, core investigator at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.\n\nRestless legs syndrome causes a person to feel a powerful urge to move his or her legs. The legs become uncomfortable when lying down or sitting, and the condition can disrupt sleep and take a toll on the quality of life, the researchers said.\n\nOne expert, Dr. Martin Niethammer, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Center of North Shore-LIJ's Cushing Neuroscience Institute in Manhasset, N.Y., said this study is merely a review of the current treatments for restless legs syndrome.\n\n\"There is nothing new here at all,\" he said. \"It doesn't add anything to the field.\"\n\nThis is just a compilation of evidence that follows guidelines that have been long established in both Europe and the United States, Niethammer said.\n\n\"These are the only treatments approved by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],\" he added.\n\nThe report was published in the March 4 online issue of JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nFor the analysis, Wilt's team reviewed 29 clinical trials. The researchers found that 61 percent of those taking dopamine agonists showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms, compared with 41 percent of those taking an inactive placebo.\n\nIn addition, those taking dopamine agonists slept better and scored higher on measures of quality of life. Dopamine agonists were originally developed to treat Parkinson's disease.\n\nSide effects of dopamine agonists can include euphoria, hallucinations, weight loss, nausea, insomnia, tiredness or weakness, dizziness and drowsiness.\n\nThere are generic versions of Requip that cost far less, running between $11 and $22 a month. Insurance covers the treatment in most cases, so actual out-of-pocket costs will vary by insurance plan. The same is true for levodopa, Wilt said.\n\nNeurontin and Lyrica also helped relieve symptoms in 61 percent of patients, compared with 37 percent of those taking a placebo, the researchers found.\n\nThe most common side effects of these drugs include fatigue, swelling in the legs, dizziness and weight gain.\n\nWithout insurance, Lyrica costs can run more than $100 a month, but again co-pays will vary by plan, Wilt said. The same is true for Neurontin, which can cost $117 to $135 a month without insurance.\n\nWilt noted there is no information on the effectiveness of treatments in pregnant women, young or old patients, those with milder symptoms or those with other serious medical conditions. \"We urge caution in extending our conclusions to these individuals,\" he noted.\n\n\"Treatments for restless legs syndrome is now frequently advertised direct-to-consumer, and thus while this may enhance awareness it may result in patients seeking treatment for milder or other conditions not well-studied,\" he explained.\n\nThe harms of medications may outweigh benefits for these individuals, Wilt said. \"Up to 25 to 50 percent with even moderate to severe and longstanding symptoms stop taking these medications after more than a year due to either side effects or lack of benefit,\" he noted.\n\nNonetheless, for people with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome symptoms, these medications provided important benefits, at least in the short term, Wilt said.\n\nPatients should tell their doctors if they have bothersome sensations in their legs that include distressing, irresistible urge to move them that is relieved by rest, Wilt said.\n\n\"This may be due to restless legs syndrome or other conditions.

Isaacs, a professor of urology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University and an author of the new report, said that if research validates what has been found, men may want to get the new genetic test when they are young, 35, say. Those at high risk because of their genetics might then choose to start prostate-cancer screening earlier than the usual age of about 50, using a blood test that looks for proteins secreted by prostate tumors.\n\n\u201cI think that makes sense,\u201d said Dr. Howard Sandler, a professor of radiation oncology at the University of Michigan and a spokesman for the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\nBut others worry that more frequent testing could exacerbate what is already a major problem: most prostate cancers grow so slowly that they would have been harmless if left alone. But since doctors cannot tell which are dangerous, they treat nearly all that they find. And treatment has serious side effects, including, often, impotence and incontinence. Nonetheless, researchers say, the test is a harbinger of things to come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the boutique medicine of the future,\u201d said Dr. Peter C. Albertsen, a surgery professor and prostate cancer specialist at the University of Connecticut. \u201cWe can know what diseases we will have to face in the rest of our lives.\u201d\n\nThat worries him, as it does Dr. Edward P. Gelmann, deputy director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University. \u201cTechnology today enables us to find out a huge amount of information,\u201d Dr. Gelmann said. \u201cBut how does the public deal with this information? How does it help them make decisions? And if they make a decision, does that lead to a day, a week, a month, of life saved?\u201d\n\nThe study, by scientists at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the Harvard School of Public Health, and Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, will appear in the Feb. 28 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. It was released online on Wednesday, a journal spokeswoman said, because \u201cit is a very active area of research with a lot of competition.\u201d\n\nResearchers long knew that the disease often runs in families. Though scientists spent years looking for genes, they found none that were reproducibly associated with a marked effect.\n\nWith new technology to scan the entire length of a person\u2019s DNA, researchers tried a new approach. They began looking for small variations in tiny DNA regions that were associated with prostate cancer. That resulted in the discovery, by several groups of investigators in Iceland and the United States, of the gene variants, small alterations in gene sequences. Unlike traditional genetic links to disease, the variants are not mutations that destroy a gene\u2019s function. In fact, no one knows what their effect is.\n\nThe next step was to ask whether those variants really could predict who had prostate cancer. So Dr. Jianfeng Xu, a professor of epidemiology and cancer biology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and his colleagues studied a Swedish population of 2,893 men with prostate cancer and 1,781 men who did not have it. That led to their finding that each of the five variants independently predicted prostate cancer risk.\n\n\u201cEach confers a moderate risk,\u201d Dr. Xu said, adding that the effect of having just one of the variants \u2014 a 10 or 20 percent increase in a man\u2019s chance of having prostate cancer \u2014 was not enough to justify using a single variant for screening. But, he added, because each conferred an independent risk, the risks added up so that the more men had, the greater their risk. Then they found that family history of the cancer added an independent risk. \u201cThat was very, very surprising to us,\u201d Dr. Xu said.\n\nThe next step, Dr. Isaacs said, is to look in other populations. \u201cWe think that can happen almost instantaneously,\u201d he said, explaining how scientists have blood samples and family histories of thousands of men who were tested for prostate cancer.\n\nBut some said that if the test leads to more screening, it is not necessarily a good thing. There is already too much prostate-cancer screening, they say, resulting in too much treatment. \u201cTo me, it is a nightmare,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said. \u201cWe are just feeding off of this cancer phobia.\u201d\n\nWhat is needed, and what the new test does not provide, is a way to decide which cancers are dangerous and which are not, Dr. Isaacs said. Still, he said the new test could help patients if it was used with caution. \u201cWe may be premature with this idea \u2014 everyone has a different way of thinking about this \u2014 but it should not take five years to know if we are on the right track. All this can happen very rapidly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have worked with enough families that have a positive family history to know that people are anxious to know their risk of prostate cancer,\u201d he said.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story included a cost for the test.", "answer": 1, "paragraphs": ["The researchers report that nearly half of the cases of prostate cancer among the roughly 5,000 men in the study could be attributed to the five gene regions and a family history, with some men having one or two of the gene variants and others having all five and a family history.", "Prostate cancer becomes more common as men age \u2014 autopsies of elderly men find that most had prostate cancer, whether they knew it or not.

"annotations": []}, {"article": "David Longnecker lay on a table in the cardiac catheterization lab of George Washington University Hospital, steeling himself for a procedure that would reveal the cause of the bout of crushing chest pain that had triggered the ambulance trip from his Dupont Circle office. Doctors had ruled out a heart attack and ordered an angiogram to check for blockages in his coronary arteries. If one was found, he would undergo angioplasty, which involves placement of a metal stent to prop open the artery.\n\nShortly before the procedure, Ramesh Mazhari, the interventional cardiologist assigned to Longnecker's case, asked an unexpected question. Instead of the usual approach, in which a catheter is inserted in the groin and threaded up the large femoral artery, would Longnecker agree to Mazhari's preferred method: accessing the heart through the smaller radial artery on the underside of the wrist?\n\n\"I said, 'If you're confident doing it, fine,' \" recalled Longnecker, 70, former chairman of anesthesiology and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania. A member of the Institute of Medicine and a director of the Association of American Medical Colleges, Longnecker said he had never seen catheterization performed in this manner, and few of his physician friends who are not cardiologists had heard of it.\n\nThat is likely to change. A small but growing cadre of cardiac specialists, among them Mazhari, are embracing the newer approach, convinced it is more comfortable and safer for many patients than femoral access, the standard for more than three decades. Some recent studies have found the approach has a lower rate of complications, including severe bleeding, than femoral procedures.\n\nOnly 1 percent of the 1.2 million cardiac catheterizations performed annually in the United States are done through the wrist; the newer approach is often preferred for patients who are extremely obese or have poor leg circulation. But in Europe, Canada and Japan, about 50 percent of catheterizations are performed using the technique devised in the early 1990s. The approach allows patients to sit up immediately afterward and even walk, an impossibility in femoral procedures, which require that they lie flat on their backs for several hours to prevent severe bleeding.\n\nBecause patients tend to recover faster, Mazhari said, she discharges some patients the same day, avoiding an expensive overnight hospital stay.\n\nQuestions about the best method of performing cardiac catheterizations, one of the most common procedures in medicine and among the most profitable for hospitals -- Medicare reimburses GWU about $10,600 for an angioplasty involving one stent -- reflect some of the issues in the roiling health-care debate. Is the radial approach, which has a steep learning curve, actually superior or largely a fad? Can it cut costs by reducing hospital stays? And if patients are given a choice of catheterization sites, what factors should they consider?\n\n\"I think there is a reluctance among physicians who are used to doing procedures a certain way\" to change, said Mazhari, who learned to do the procedure last year and uses it about 80 percent of the time. She and others say they know of no other physician in the Washington area who favors the radial approach.\n\nIn Boston, a city brimming with teaching hospitals and interventional cardiologists -- heart specialists with advanced training who perform procedures -- only a handful of physicians specialize in radial catheterization, said Pinak B. Shah, director of interventional cardiology training at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"There's no data out there to suggest it is worse and growing evidence that it may be better,\" said Shah, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who performs 60 to 70 percent of procedures through the wrist.\n\nShah said he believes a combination of financial self-interest, the relative paucity of medical devices designed for radial access, resistance by older physicians and the general tendency of doctors to regard patient discomfort as secondary have contributed to under-use of the approach.\n\nSome senior interventional cardiologists say they worry that the method may be hyped.\n\n\"I think it's a good procedure in the right hands for the right reasons,\" said Bryan Raybuck, director of the cardiac catheterization lab at the Inova Heart and Vascular Institute in Fairfax. Raybuck, who learned to perform the procedure in Quebec 12 years ago, estimates he uses it fewer than two dozen times annually, and only when circumstances require it.\n\n\"There's a lot of buzz about this right now,\" he said of radial procedures, which account for about 150 of the 8,000 cardiac catheterizations done at his hospital annually. \"I don't think it's worth going across the river to do it. It's not that good.\"\n\nWilliam O. Suddath, an interventional cardiologist at Washington Hospital Center, home to the area's busiest cardiac catheterization lab, said doctors there also prefer the femoral approach, which has benefited from improvements in devices used to stop bleeding. \"There's an inherent conservatism in medicine for many reasons,\" he said.\n\nSuddath said he is concerned about the \"tremendous amount of competition going on in centers around the country.\" And he worries that radial procedures are being used as a \"marketing ploy\" by some hospitals \"to lure patients to particular cath labs.\"\n\nShah is familiar with such skepticism. \"I think the people who pooh-pooh it don't spend the time learning how to do it,\" said Shah, who has performed more than 250 radial procedures in the two years since he trained to do them in Canada.\n\nIn the cath lab, he noted, \"time is money\" and radial procedures are \"among the most challenging things we do.\" Until doctors achieve proficiency, they can be agonizingly slow; the fee remains the same, whether a case takes 30 minutes or five hours. Shah said it took him 50 cases \"before a lot of the butterflies in my stomach had flown away.\" Some doctors say it takes 100 cases to achieve true proficiency.\n\nOne reason for the greater difficulty is anatomical. The femoral artery, approximately the width of a pinkie, presents a direct route to the heart; to a physician, it's a straight stretch of freeway that can be navigated easily. The radial artery is thinner and offers a much more circuitous path, more like driving on a two-lane mountain road with frequent switchbacks.\n\n\"You have to be very patient and very meticulous,\" Mazhari said.\n\nSevere bleeding is a feared complication in femoral procedures; the risk of a major complication is 1 to 3 percent. Arterial spasms top the list of radial complications. They are most common, Shah said, in \"little old ladies,\" who tend to have small arteries that can clamp shut. \"There are some horror stories about that,\" he said.\n\nShah and Mazhari say that their patients, many of whom have undergone both kinds of catheterizations, much prefer the wrist approach.\n\n\"We've got a lot of repeat customers, unfortunately,\" Shah said. Lying flat and motionless for two to six hours while recovering, he said, can be hard for patients with bad backs, and many older men find it difficult to urinate in this position.\n\nWilliam Sanford, who underwent angioplasty in April, was thrilled not to be among them.\n\n\"I could get right up and go to the bathroom,\" said Sanford, 64, who lives in Silver Spring and was taken by ambulance to GWU after suffering chest pain while working the night shift as a maintenance supervisor in the Capitol. \"I was so surprised at how easy it was and how comfortable it was.\"\n\nTwo recent studies that compared the approaches found a lower rate of serious complications among patients undergoing radial procedures.\n\nA report in the August 2008 Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Interventions compared outcome data for more than 593,000 procedures -- 7,800 of them radial -- performed between 2004 and 2007 at 606 hospitals.\n\nLed by Sunil V. Rao at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the authors found that outcomes were similar but that bleeding complications were 58 percent lower in the wrist group. The reduction was most pronounced among high-risk patients, including women and those over 75.\n\n\"These data support the efficiency and safety [of radial surgery] . . . and suggest that wider application of the radial approach may enhance the safety of coronary intervention,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nIn the January issue of American Heart Journal, a meta-analysis of 28 years of studies, some of them conducted in Europe and Canada, found a 73 percent reduction in bleeding and shorter hospitals stay among radial patients.\n\nLongnecker, who lives in Annapolis, said that for him, the benefit is clear.\n\nFour years ago he underwent a spinal procedure that was performed through the femoral artery. \"Afterward I had to lie flat for eight hours with five- or six-pound sandbags on the site\" to prevent bleeding, he recalled. His groin was black and blue for two weeks.\n\nAfter his radial angioplasty, he was allowed to sit up immediately and walk. A clear wristband equipped with a small inflatable balloon was affixed to his wrist to close the artery. It was removed after about eight hours and replaced by a simple bandage.\n\n\"It was remarkably more comfortable and less constraining,\" Longnecker said. \"All that remained the next day was a little red dot. My wrist felt fine. I could have played tennis.\n\n\"If somebody offered me the option of having a procedure radially or femorally,\" Longnecker said, \"I would make the decision before their sentence was finished.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story mentions that using the wrist may better enable patients to avoid an \"expensive overnight hospital stay\" and that Medicare reimbursement was the same even though this route for catheterization may involve more physician time.

The treatment, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is covered by Medicare in five states, but few private insurers pay for it routinely.\n\nWhile rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. The technique has been shown to work better than a placebo, but the proportion of patients who show complete relief ranges widely, from as few as 10 percent to as many as 57 percent, according to various studies.\n\nThe debate has huge implications, not just for many of the 14 million Americans who suffer from major depression every year but also for businesses eyeing a potentially lucrative market and insurers weighing whether to cover it.\n\nAbout half of those 14 million Americans seek relief through psychotherapy and prescription drug treatment, according to an evaluation by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But studies show that antidepressants provide complete cessation of symptoms only about a third of the time. Magnetic stimulation is aimed at patients with such \u201ctreatment-resistant depression.\u201d\n\nSupporters say rTMS is worth the cost \u2014 between $6,000 and $12,000 for the four-to-six-week treatment \u2014 because it enables people such as Curtis to resume productive lives.\n\nSkeptics question the price tag in light of uncertain benefits.\n\n\u201cThe majority of studies that evaluated rTMS failed to find evidence of an enduring treatment effect after the initial response . . . and some . . . failed to find any significant treatment effect,\u201d concluded Health Plan of Nevada, a UnitedHealthcare insurer, which rejected coverage in March.\n\nWith the nation\u2019s health-care spending expected to top $2.7 trillion this year, the battle over paying for rTMS demonstrates why it is so difficult to rein in health-care costs. New technology is generally allowed into the market after studies show it is reasonably safe and more effective than placebos. But that\u2019s not the same as showing it works better than current approaches.\n\nExperts differ over whether it\u2019s smart to cover new techniques if they haven\u2019t proved superior to established methods. And they can also disagree over the medical research itself: Was a study done well? Were there enough patients enrolled? Did it ask the right questions? Insurers often call for more research, while doctors and patients \u2014 many desperate for help \u2014 warn against delay. And costs are rarely discussed publicly.\n\n\u2018What did I have to lose?\u2019\n\nIn December, when Curtis first had a magnetic coil placed on her scalp while a $70,000 machine sent pulses into part of her brain, she had already spent a decade trying seven different prescription medications in her battle with depression.\n\nGetting no relief but gaining weight and feeling sluggish and \u201cout of it\u201d because of the drugs\u2019 side effects, she eagerly agreed to the month-long series of five-day-a-week treatments. Most patients have between four and six weeks of near daily sessions.\n\nCurtis\u2019s psychiatrist, Niku Singh, who is also the medical director at TMS NeuroHealth, suggested that she try the procedure. \u201cI was all for it,\u201d said Curtis, whose insurance did not cover the treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of nothing else had worked, so what did I have to lose?\u201d\n\nAs the very first patient treated at the Tysons Corner facility, which opened in December, Curtis paid only $3,000 because the center needed a test patient to meet the requirements of the device manufacturer. The fee is generally about $10,000, but officials say they work with patients who can't afford that. Founders of the center compare rTMS\u2019s potential to that of the now-ubiquitous laser eye clinics; they aim to open a chain of centers nationally that will take walk-ins and accept referrals from physicians. Walk-in patients without a doctor referral would be screened by the center\u2019s medical director to determine if they are in fact appropriate candidates for rTMS treatment.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the Lasik model and said, \u2018Can we do this with depression? Can we do this with TMS?\u2019\u201d said Bill Leonard, president of the company.\n\nDuring a treatment, a patient sits in a chair like one in a dentist\u2019s office while an electromagnetic coil is placed against her head. The machine sends four seconds of magnetic pulses into the brain in 26-second intervals, making a woodpecker-like tapping noise. The whole procedure takes about 40 minutes and is monitored by a technician. Patients say it does not hurt. Studies have shown that side effects are few and generally minor, such as headaches and scalp irritations.\n\nSingh said rTMS works by having the pulses stimulate a region of the brain that helps control mood; researchers say the pulses help depression by activating the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. (Singh, who owns two psychiatry practices in the region, says he does not have an investment interest in TMS NeuroHealth.)\n\nThe use of rTMS for altering mood or affecting the brain has been studied since at least the early 1990s. After reviewing data from a study of 301 patients, the FDA cleared the device in 2008 for the treatment of major depression in adults who had failed to improve after at least one round of drug therapy.\n\nThat study was funded by the device\u2019s manufacturer, Neuronetics, a company based in Malvern, Pa. It found that up to 17 percent of patients treated with the device for six weeks became symptom-free, about twice as many as those treated with a sham rTMS machine.\n\nSubsequent studies have shown a range of results, with about a third of patients reporting complete relief. One 2010 study of 199 \u201cmoderately treatment resistent\u201d patients funded by the National Institute of Mental Health found that rTMS was four times as likely to get patients symptom-free as was a sham procedure. Patients in that study were treated five times a week for three to five weeks. One key measure \u2014 known as the \u201cnumber needed to treat\u201d \u2014 found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. Five percent of the patients in the sham group became symptom-free.\n\nSupporters such as those at TMS NeuroHealth say they are seeing better results than that among their patients, who can continue taking antidepressants along with their treatment. Curtis, for example, still takes a daily antidepressant four months after completing her treatment, but she has been able to sharply reduce the dosage.\n\nCurtis said she noticed no change in her depression at the very start of her rTMS treatment, but she began feeling better after about two weeks of treatment. \u201cI\u2019m not up and down anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nFor patients who don\u2019t respond to prescription drugs and talk therapy, the other major option is electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, in which an electrical current is sent through the brain to deliberately cause a seizure. The procedure, which is more widely used than rTMS, requires two to three treatments a week for three to four weeks and is effective for many patients. But it requires anesthesia and sometimes causes memory loss or confusion. rTMS does not require anesthesia, and its side effects are generally mild. A few small studies have looked at its effects on cognitive function and found either no effect or slight improvement, according to the AHRQ analysis.

In the eight-week arm, the first three doses were given every four weeks.\n\nAfter a year, roughly 95 percent of the patients in all the arms of the trial maintained their vision, meaning their ability to read an eye chart declined by no more than 15 letters, or three lines.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye was also \u201cnoninferior\u201d to Lucentis in terms of the average change in vision after one year. Lucentis recipients had a mean gain of 8.1 letters and 9.4 letters in the two trials. Those getting Regeneron\u2019s drug every eight weeks had gains of 7.9 letters and 8.9 letters.\n\nRegeneron said the two drugs were equally safe.\n\nBoth VEGF Trap-Eye and Lucentis block a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor that causes blood vessels to grow and leak into the eye.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye could become the first big product for Regeneron, which was founded in 1988 and is based in Tarrytown, N.Y. It sells one drug for a rare disease and has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars from licensing deals with big pharmaceutical companies.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug is likely to face competition from off-label use of Genentech\u2019s cancer drug Avastin. When used in the eye, Avastin costs about $50 a dose, compared with about $2,000 for Lucentis. Still, even with such low-priced competition, Lucentis has sales exceeding $2 billion globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Advanced Cell Technology, of Marlborough, Mass., said it would test its stem cell therapy on 12 adults with severe vision loss caused by Stargardt\u2019s, an inherited disease.\n\nThe company has turned human embryonic stem cells into retinal pigment epithelial cells, which will be surgically implanted into the eye. The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cells are controversial because their creation usually entails the destruction of human embryos, although Advanced Cell Technology is working on a technique to avoid that.\n\nEmbryonic cells can also form tumors if injected into the body. Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientist at Advanced Cell, said the company had to prove to the F.D.A. that its retinal cells contained virtually no residual embryonic stem cells. It took a year for the company to get clearance for the trial from the F.D.A.\n\nIt is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Its shares closed at 5 cents on Friday.\n\nDr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body\u2019s immune system.\n\nThere is no treatment for Stargardt\u2019s, which affects more than 25,000 people in the United States. The disease is usually diagnosed during childhood and it causes a loss of central vision, though not usually peripheral vision.\n\nRyan Rapoport of Newcastle, Wash., who has the disease, \u201cbasically went from normal vision to legally blind in seven months,\u201d said his father, Darrin.\n\nRyan, now 10, cannot be in the trial because, for safety reasons, it is confined to adults.

A head-to-head trial of Avastin and Lucentis is now underway that will probably have important implications for pricing and prescribing of these drugs. (If Avastin works just as well as Lucentis, more doctors will presumably switch to it at much lower cost to patients.)\u00a0Moreover, allegations have surfaced recently that Genentech is providing questionable\u00a0financial inducements for doctors to use the more costly Lucentis instead of Avastin. Given the significance of these developments for anyone who needs or may need treatment for AMD,\u00a0we feel the\u00a0story could have and probably should have gone into\u00a0a bit more detail about why these two drugs have\u00a0such wildly different costs.\nWe also think that if the story is interviewing a company about its plans to seek marketing approval in just a few months, they certainly could get some kind of pricing estimate from them.

wear sandals. Not even at the beach in July.\n\nToenail fungus causes nails to become thick, yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful. Sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs, topical treatments and home remedies, sometimes to no avail. It tends to be a cosmetic issue for the younger set and a pain issue for older folks.\n\n\u201cThe problem is huge. It is bigger than you can imagine,\u201d says Washington podiatrist Stephen J. Kominsky. \u201cI would say 70 percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails.\u201d\n\nThere may be hope. Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection \u2014 or wastes their patients\u2019 money because it doesn\u2019t work, depending on whom you ask.\n\nThe treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient\u2019s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. The nails aren\u2019t immediately clear after the treatment, which takes up to an hour; the patient must wait for the fungus-free nails to grow out.\n\nLast year, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the first laser, PinPointe, for \u201ctemporary increase of clear nail\u201d in patients with onychomycosis, the medical term for a fungal infection of the nail. The FDA cleared a second one, GenesisPlus, in April. Practitioners have been using other lasers on toenail fungus since about 2009.\n\nKominsky has treated 400 to 500 patients with the PinPointe laser. Compared with oral medication, he says, \u201cthe odds of success are better with the laser; plus, there\u2019s no side effects.\u201d\n\nThe most common oral treatment, Lamisil, works for about two out of three patients, according to Lamisil\u2019s FDA-approved prescribing information, but it has been associated with rare cases of serious liver problems. Other potential side effects include diarrhea, headache, rashes and changes in taste. According to Lamisil\u2019s manufacturer, Novartis, the relapse rate is 15 percent one year after completing treatment.\n\nIn one small study about laser treatment for toenail fungus, which appeared last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association, \u201c26 eligible toes (ten mild, seven moderate, and nine severe)\u201d were treated with a laser produced by Nomir Medical Technologies, which is still seeking FDA approval. After six months, 85 percent of the toenails had improved.\n\n\u201cI never use the term \u2018cured\u2019 with toenail fungus,\u201d Kominsky says. \u201cWith a cure, people think there\u2019s no chance for a recurrence. In this case, there is a chance.\u201d\n\nEven John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment.\n\nResearch done by PinPointe, which is based in Chico, Calif., identified more than 100 organisms, including fungi, yeast, mold and bacteria, that work together to cause toenail fungus.\n\nThere\u2019s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. Fungi love moist, dark environments such as wet shoes, Kominsky says, so people such as lifeguards, landscapers and fishermen are particularly susceptible. Shoes are the reason why toenail fungus is much more common than fingernail fungus, which can also occur.\n\nThe elderly are more likely to have toenail fungus than younger people because they have had more years to be exposed to the infection and their immune systems can\u2019t always fight it off, according to Washington podiatrist Lee Firestone. He estimates that about half of people over 70 have toenail fungus.\n\nLast year, Americans spent $354 million on prescription and over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company.\n\n\u201cI think the laser can improve the appearance of the nail, but it\u2019s only temporary and it needs to be used again and again to maintain that improvement,\u201d says Firestone, who doesn\u2019t use the lasers in his practice. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.\u201d\n\nFirestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can\u2019t penetrate the nail root. Home remedies such as tea tree oil, bleach and vinegar also don\u2019t work, he says.\n\nYet even a superficial improvement would be an improvement for many.\n\nRichard, a retiree in Fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus, got a laser treatment on all 10 toes in April 2010, and he says his nails were fully cleared of the yellowed, thickened look after a year. To prevent reinfection, he has purchased all new socks and a SteriShoe, a $130 device that uses ultraviolet light to sanitize shoes, at his podiatrist\u2019s recommendation. He has also turned to what he calls \u201can old wives\u2019 tale\u201d that he read about in a newspaper column: slathering Vicks VapoRub on his toes.\n\n\u201cMy doctor said, \u2018Listen, it\u2019s not a prescribed treatment, but if it works for you, for heaven\u2019s sake, do it.\u2019 \u201d", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story did a good job on this point.

Finasteride might not make much of a difference in the death rate because so few men die from prostate cancer. What the drug\u2019s proponents are advocating is taking a drug to somehow compensate for what many believe is the nation\u2019s overzealous diagnosis and treatment of the disease.\n\nDr. Peter Albertsen, a prostate cancer specialist at the University of Connecticut, explains: While 10 percent of men 55 and older find out they have prostate cancer, the cancer is lethal in no more than 25 percent of them. So if finasteride reduced the prostate cancer\u2019s incidence by 30 percent, about 7 percent of men would get a cancer diagnosis and approximately 1.8 percent instead of 2.5 percent would have a lethal cancer.\n\n\u201cFinasteride might make a difference but only in a very small subset of men,\u201d Dr. Albertsen said.\n\nAnd, he adds, the study did not look for a decline in death rates, and it is unlikely that any study ever will \u2014 it would take too long and be too expensive. Yet the ultimate goal of prevention is to save lives. It remains an assumption that finasteride would have much impact on the minority of prostate cancers that, despite early detection and treatment, still kill.\n\nFinasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone active mostly in the prostate and the scalp, and that all prostate cancers need to grow.\n\nThe drug is available from Merck & Company, as Proscar, and from six companies as a generic to shrink the prostate in older men whose prostates can enlarge, making urination difficult.\n\nResearchers say it turns out that shrinking the prostate also may be good for cancer detection by making it easier to find all tumors, including the most aggressive.\n\n\u201cThe data are compelling,\u201d said Dr. Peter Scardino, chairman of the department of surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a convert who originally thought the drug was dangerous. \u201cFinasteride has to be recognized as the first clearly demonstrated way to prevent prostate cancer with any medication or any oral agent at all.\u201d\n\nFinasteride has had its ups and downs. Its chronicle began in 1993, with the start of a study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and involving 19,000 men. Half took finasteride pills; the rest a placebo. In March 2003, 15 months before the study\u2019s scheduled end, its directors halted it abruptly. The reason was that the results were overwhelmingly compelling \u2014 men taking the drug were not getting prostate cancer.\n\nYet despite that note of triumph, a troubling finding emerged. The study was designed to look for a reduction in the overall prostate cancer rate. And that is what it found. But, as Dr. Scardino pointed out in an editorial five years ago in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the study, it appeared that 6.4 percent of the men who took the drug got fast growing, ominous-looking tumors. In contrast, such tumors were found in 5.1 percent, of men who took the placebo.\n\nThe concern was that the drug might be preventing cancers that never spread. At the same time, finasteride might actually be causing aggressive cancers that can kill.\n\nIt would, of course, be the worse possible outcome. Dr. Scardino\u2019s editorial warned healthy men not to take finasteride.\n\nThat seemed to leave the drug dead. The study researchers, though, wondered if that conclusion was correct. Maybe, they thought, by shrinking the prostate, the drug was just making it easier to find aggressive tumors.\n\nWhen doctors do a biopsy for prostate cancer, they probe the gland with a needle, hoping to find cancer cells. But prostate cancer grows as little nests and an aggressive cancer will appear as dangerous-looking cells in some clusters and less dangerous in others. A smaller prostate means a doctor is more likely to hit upon cancer nests and more likely to find aggressive-looking cells.\n\nThe researchers had a way to learn if they were correct. Most of the men in the study who had cancer \u2014 aggressive or not \u2014 chose to be treated and many had their prostates removed. A pathologist could carefully examine every one of those 500 prostates and compare the kinds of cancers found at surgery to those initially diagnosed at biopsy.\n\nIt took years, but the analysis showed the hypothesis was right. Now, two groups of independent researchers conclude, in papers in the current issue of Cancer Prevention Research, that finasteride decreases the risk of having any tumor at all \u2014 large or small, fast growing or slow growing, by the same amount \u2014 nearly 30 percent.\n\nWith this new analysis, many prostate cancer specialists, including Dr. Scardino, say their view of the drug has completely changed. The study actually found that finasteride protects against both lethal and less dangerous tumors and could cut prostate cancer risk by nearly a third.\n\nEven the effect on smaller tumors has important implications, said Dr. Ian M. Thompson, Jr., the study\u2019s principal researcher and a urologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.\n\n\u201cThe cancers that were prevented were the ones men are having surgery and radiation for today,\u201d Dr. Thompson said.\n\nNow, though, prostate cancer specialists have a new problem: How can they change the drug\u2019s image?\n\nDrug companies are unlikely to be instrumental, Dr. Thompson and others say, because finasteride\u2019s patent has expired, giving companies little incentive to apply to the Food and Drug Administration to market it as a cancer preventative. Without F.D.A. approval, finasteride cannot be advertised as preventing cancer and insurers may not pay for it.\n\nBut doctors can prescribe drugs for other purposes at their discretion and Dr. Parnes said that men and their doctors may be persuaded to try it.\n\nIn the meantime, GlaxoSmithKline, which has a patented drug, Avodart, to reduce the size of men\u2019s prostates, has a study asking whether its drug can prevent prostate cancer. If it can, and the drug agency approves Avodart for cancer prevention, doctors and patients may have to decide between a generic drug used off-label or a more expensive brand-name drug that does much the same thing.\n\nSome leading prostate specialists, like Dr. Scardino, say they are recommending that men who worry about prostate cancer take finasteride.\n\nHe also ponders taking it himself. \u201cI regularly think, Why don\u2019t I take it? Why wouldn\u2019t every man take it?\u201d Dr. Scardino said. He hasn\u2019t done so yet, partly because those years of concern about the drug took a toll.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the difficulty of adjusting to something that originally had a bad reputation,\u201d Dr. Scardino explained.\n\nDr. Thompson has no such fears.\n\nHe is at no particular risk for prostate cancer, but, he reasons, taking finasteride is not that different than taking a statin for a slightly elevated cholesterol level.\n\n\u201cImagine the marathoner with no family history of heart disease, who\u2019s skinny, doesn\u2019t smoke and has normal blood pressure,\u201d Dr. Thompson says. \u201cShould he take a statin? The amount of benefit he\u2019ll get is not much, but his risk reduction still is 25 or 30 percent.\u201d\n\nDr. Thompson knows what he will do about finasteride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 54,\u201d he said. \u201cThe men in the study were 55 and older.

It took two years before the National Cancer Institute and its researchers could even agree on a design for the large new American study that will test the idea that many women might safely forgo chemotherapy.\n\nThe study, which starts enrolling patients at the end of this month, will involve women whose cancers are fueled by estrogen and have not spread beyond the breast. They will be randomly assigned to have the standard treatment \u2014 chemotherapy followed by a drug like tamoxifen that starves tumors of estrogen \u2014 or to skip chemotherapy and have treatment only with a drug like tamoxifen.\n\nUnlike the American study, the one now planned in Europe will also include women whose cancer has spread beyond their breasts into nearby lymph nodes. The American study may eventually add such women, said Sheila E. Taube, who directs the cancer diagnosis program at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nDr. Taube said the debate reminded her of one a few decades ago, when the question was whether all women with cancer needed mastectomies or whether many could have a lumpectomy instead. \"To me, the situations are analogous,\" she said.\n\nThe chemotherapy question starts with American and European guidelines that say almost every woman with breast cancer that has gone beyond its earliest stages, when it is confined to the milk duct, should have the treatment. And for good reason, many cancer researchers say: a series of large studies has shown that chemotherapy saves lives and that newer and more aggressive regimens are improvements over older ones.\n\nThat has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone.\n\n\"Part of it is that this area of medicine we're practicing in is kind of a high wire act,\" said Dr. Michael Lee, an oncologist in private practice in Norfolk, Va. \"It is more comfortable to adopt things that are aggressive.\"\n\nBut most of those studies were done at a time when doctors did not distinguish between the 70 percent of women with breast cancers fueled by estrogen and the 30 percent whose cancers were not.\n\nNow Dr. Berry, the M. D. Anderson statistician, and a group of leading cancer researchers have found that the chemotherapy benefits in those clinical trials were concentrated almost exclusively in women whose cancers were impervious to estrogen. For the others, with estrogen-sensitive tumors, the lifesaving benefit came from hormonal therapy. The results of the analysis, published recently in The Journal of the American Medical Association, were the same even if the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes.\n\nThe drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine.\n\nThere is also another issue. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? How can they be identified?\n\nOne possibility is new genetic tests, which are part of the two studies that are about to begin. The cancer institute is using the Oncotype DX test, which includes genes associated with response to chemotherapy, among them genes involved with a cell's response to estrogen.\n\nThe study is ethical, said Dr. Larry Norton of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, because the only women whose treatment will be decided at random are those in a kind of gray area, not women for whom chemotherapy would be a clear benefit or clearly unnecessary.\n\n\"I think the clinical trial is really a superb one,\" Dr. Norton said. \"I would like to see it go so we have definitive data.\"\n\nIn the meantime, some physicians, like Dr. Winer, are taking their own best shot at figuring out who really benefits from chemotherapy. He asks how sensitive the tumor is to estrogen, how aggressive a pathologist believes it is, how big it is, how much has spread to the lymph nodes and whether its surface has a type of protein, HER2, that is associated with a better response to chemotherapy. After talking through the decision with his patients, he says, he is comfortable omitting chemotherapy in some who would have had it not long ago.\n\nOthers, like Dr. Francisco J. Esteva of M. D. Anderson, use a computer program to calculate a woman's risks of recurrence and give the option of no chemotherapy only to women with low-risk cancers confined to their breasts.\n\nStill others, like Dr. Glick, are starting to tell women with estrogen-fed cancers that although they still need chemotherapy, they may not need the most intense treatment.\n\nAnd while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do.\n\n\"I don't know that many doctors who are comfortable giving women an option about chemotherapy,\" said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group. \"A lot of physicians talk about the data, but then they say, 'But, to be on the safe side. ...' \"\n\nStill, doctors say it is not simply that they are urging more and more chemotherapy on patients. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.\n\n\"A cancer diagnosis is earth-shattering,\" said Dr. Lee, who has had cancer himself. \"You stay up at night. You wonder. Even when you're doing well, you don't know whether to trust it.\"\n\nAnd so, he said, \"a lot of people will take a treatment even if there is a very low statistical chance that they will benefit.\"\n\nThat was what happened a few months ago, when Dr. Esteva told Janice Baty of Sulphur, La., a 40-year-old mother of two, that she might not need chemotherapy. After a long discussion with Ms. Baty and her husband, Dr. Esteva left them so they could decide what to do.\n\n\"My husband said, 'Look, we have two little kids,' \" Ms. Baty recalled. \"I called the doctor back in and said, 'We're doing the chemo.' \"\n\nWomen who say they want the most aggressive treatment may not fully realize what they are asking for, said Mary Peelen, 45, of San Francisco. Ms. Peelen learned in January 2005 that she had cancer. It was small, was fed by estrogen and had spread to just two of her lymph nodes. Her oncologist was adamant: chemotherapy was her only option.\n\n\"I felt frightened and very coerced,\" she said. She had an aggressive regimen, suffered terribly and was left with painful nerve damage in her arms and hands that prevents movements like opening jars or using scissors and frequently makes her drop things.\n\nMs. Peelen feels that in a way, she just missed the revolution, perhaps one of the last women with her type of cancer who will have to suffer so much.\n\nFor now, the answers as to who should have chemotherapy are far from clear.\n\n\"I think practice should change, but it's very dicey,\" said Dr. Berry, of M. D. Anderson.\n\nHis colleague Dr. Esteva says it is one thing for a statistician like Dr. Berry to look at retrospective data, and another for a physician, like himself, to sit down with a patient who has to make what may be a life-or-death decision.\n\n\"It's not a perfect science,\" Dr. Esteva said. \"A statistically small reduction in risk may be very important to some women, while for others chemotherapy is not worth it.\"\n\nAnd so, Dr. Esteva said, he is left asking many women with early-stage breast cancer to decide what can seem like the undecidable: whether they want \"to take something potentially toxic when you have a 90 percent chance of being cured without it.\"\n\n\"My experience ,\" he said, \"is that more want to get chemo than not.\"", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "There is no discussion of the cost of chemotherapy and no mention of potential cost savings for women who might not benefit as much from treatment; however, this is not very relevant to this story, as there is a suggestion that less treatment might be better, with a cost savings implied.

season rages across the United States, scientists have found a powerful new disinfectant that makes \"light\" work of the virus.\n\nResearchers say a certain spectrum of ultraviolet light -- called far-UVC -- easily kills airborne flu viruses while posing no risk to people.\n\nIt could offer a new, inexpensive way to eliminate airborne flu viruses in indoor public spaces such as hospitals, doctors' offices, schools, airports and aircraft, said the team from Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.\n\nThe disinfecting success of initial experiments still need to be confirmed, said lead research David Brenner.\n\nBut he believes \"the use of overhead, low-level far-UVC light in public locations would be a safe and efficient method for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis.\"\n\nAs the researchers explained, broad-spectrum UVC light kills viruses and bacteria, and it is currently used to decontaminate surgical equipment. But this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, so it's not used in public spaces.\n\nHowever, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option.\n\nIn prior studies, they found that far-UVC light killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria -- a common and dangerous \"superbug\" -- without harming human or mouse skin.\n\nIn this new study, they found that far-UVC light also killed airborne H1N1 virus, a common strain of flu virus.\n\n\"Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,\" said Brenner, who directs Columbia's Center for Radiological Research.\n\nHowever, \"because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them,\" he said in a university news release.\n\nLamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000, Brenner said, but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced.\n\n\"And unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,\" he said.\n\nTwo flu experts were encouraged by the findings.\n\n\"The prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far-UV radiation is very exciting,\" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.\n\n\"Though hand-washing remains critically important, it does not prevent every instance of transmission,\" Grosso said. \"Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations.

The app was developed by researches from the Wisconsin Institute of Surgical Outcomes Research (WiSOR), Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, with the goal of earlier detection of surgical site infections (SSIs) and prevention of hospital readmissions. The study results appear as an \"article in press\" on the website of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons ahead of print.\n\nSSIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the leading cause of hospital readmission following an operation.1,2,3 Due to the prevalence off SSIs, the WiSOR research team decided to see if postoperative wound monitoring could be effectively achieved by having patients upload photos through the WoundCare app and answer a few brief questions to gather information not easily captured through images.\n\n\"Patients cannot identify [infections] and frequently ignore or fail to recognize the early signs of cellulitis or other wound complications,\" study authors wrote. \"This drawback leads to the common and frustrating scenario where patients present to a routine, scheduled clinic appointment with an advanced wound complication that requires readmission, with or without reoperation. However, the complication may have been amenable to outpatient management if detected earlier.\"\n\nForty vascular surgery patients were enrolled in the study. There was an overall data submission rate of 90.2 percent among participants, and submissions were reviewed within an average of 9.7 hours.

Gunter, MD. . \"This approach allows us to intervene at an earlier time rather than waiting for patients to come back in after the problem has already developed past the point of being able to manage it on an outpatient basis.\"\n\nPatients were enthusiastic about the app's ease of use and the reassurance they felt having their wounds regularly monitored. The nurse practitioners responsible for reviewing the submitted images attested to the value of the photos and patient satisfaction, although they also noted it was difficult to find time to review the submitted images on top of an already heavy clinical workload. Study authors note that the success and sustainability of a post-discharge wound-monitoring protocol requires a dedicated transitional care program and not simply adding a task to the current staff workload.\n\nThis protocol also has a cost-savings component, in addition to the patient safety and satisfaction aspects. Study authors note that SSIs are the most expensive hospital-acquired infection, costing an average of nearly $30,000 per wound-related readmission and an estimated $3-10 billion annually.\n\n\"If you could imagine saving the cost from the number of patients whose readmission you were able to prevent, that result could provide significant savings to the health system,\" Dr. Gunter said. Although capturing specific numbers related to cost-savings was not part of this study, Dr. Gunter said it is an important area of focus for future studies.\n\nA limitation to telemedicine protocols that call for the use of smartphones is that not every patient has the necessary technology or knowledge to upload images on their own. The WiSOR research team addressed this issue by having participants undergo tailored training to learn to use the WoundCheck app. They provided each patient with an iPhone 5S and an accompanying visual reference guide to further assist in using the phone and app. Dr. Gunter said they were very successful in giving patients knowledge and access to technology so they could participate in the study. She said this is a model easily adaptable to other medical centers, whether through providing participants with a phone, having a rotating supply of phones at the hospitals for patients to borrow, or relying on a patient's personal device.\n\n\"We have demonstrated that a population of complex and high-risk patients, many of whom are older adults and novice smartphone users, can complete this protocol with high fidelity and satisfaction,\" the researchers concluded.\n\nStudy coauthors from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, include Sara Fernandes-Taylor, PhD, Shahrose Rahman, BS, Lola Awoyinka, MPH, Kyla M.

"category": "Question 1", "annotations": []}, {"article": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Lightly shocking a person\u2019s brain just before they learned a new task appeared to strengthen memory in a handful of patients with epilepsy, a tantalizing result that could have implications for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.\n\nPacemaker devices known as deep brain stimulators made by Medtronic and St. Jude Medical are already used to calm muscle tremors in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease and other movement disorders, and are being tested for a host of other conditions such as treatment-resistant depression.\n\nThe devices are implanted under the skin in the chest with wires leading up the neck connected to tiny electrodes implanted deep in the brain, which produce electrical impulses.\n\nThe current study was done at the University of California at Los Angeles in seven epileptic patients awaiting surgery who had electrodes implanted deep in their brains to help pinpoint the source of their seizures. The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.\n\nThey focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.\n\n\u201cThe entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain\u2019s memory mainframe,\u201d Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s chief memory center.\n\nFor the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.\n\n\u201cWhen we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,\u201d Fried said.\n\nCompared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.\n\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.\n\nFried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.\n\n\u201cThe question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,\u201d he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.\n\nDespite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer\u2019s from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.\n\nSuzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was \u201cvery excited about the finding,\u201d but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nThe Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nOne team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.

(Jan. 2, 2018) - In just four months, high-doses of vitamin D reduce arterial stiffness in young, overweight/obese, vitamin-deficient, but otherwise still healthy African-Americans, researchers say.\n\nRigid artery walls are an independent predictor of cardiovascular- related disease and death and vitamin D deficiency appears to be a contributor, says Dr. Yanbin Dong, geneticist and cardiologist at the Georgia Prevention Institute at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.\n\nSo researchers looked at baseline and again 16 weeks later in 70 African-Americans ages 13-45 - all of whom had some degree of arterial stiffness - taking varying doses of the vitamin best known for its role in bone health.\n\nIn what appears to be the first randomized trial of its kind, they found that arterial stiffness was improved by vitamin D supplementation in a dose-response manner in this population, they write in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOverweight/obese blacks are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency because darker skin absorbs less sunlight - the skin makes vitamin D in response to sun exposure - and fat tends to sequester vitamin D for no apparent purpose, says Dong, the study's corresponding author.\n\nParticipants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study's first author.\n\nThe dose, now considered the highest, safe upper dose of the vitamin by the Institute of Medicine, reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest: 10.4 percent in four months. \"It significantly and rapidly reduced stiffness,\" Raed says.\n\nTwo thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. At 600 IUs, arterial stiffness actually increased slightly - .1 percent - and the placebo group experienced a 2.3 percent increase in arterial stiffness over the timeframe.\n\nThey used the non-invasive, gold standard pulse wave velocity to assess arterial stiffness. Reported measures were from the carotid artery in the neck to the femoral artery, a major blood vessel, which supplies the lower body with blood. The American Heart Association considers this the primary outcome measurement of arterial stiffness.\n\nWhen the heart beats, it generates a waveform, and with a healthy heart and vasculature there are fewer and smaller waves. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says.\n\n\"When your arteries are more stiff, you have higher pulse wave velocity, which increases your risk of cardiometabolic disease in the future,\" says Raed.\n\nThe varying doses, as well as the placebo participants took, were all packaged the same so neither they or the investigators knew which dose, if any, they were getting until the study was complete. Both placebo and supplements were given once monthly - rather than daily at home - at the GPI to ensure consistent compliance.\n\nDong was also corresponding author on a study published in 2015 in the journal BioMed Central Obesity that showed, in this same group of individuals, both 2,000 and 4,000 IUs restored more desirable vitamin D blood levels of 30 nanograms per milliliter.\n\nThe 4,000 upper-limit dose restored healthy blood level quicker - by eight weeks - and was also better at suppressing parathyroid hormone, which works against vitamin D's efforts to improve bone health by absorbing calcium, they reported.\n\nWhile heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death than whites and the disease tends to occur earlier in life. The authors write that arterial stiffness and vitamin D deficiency might be potential contributors.\n\nWhile just how vitamin D is good for our arteries isn't completely understood, it appears to impact blood vessel health in many ways. Laboratory studies have shown that mice missing a vitamin D receptor have higher activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, says Raed. Activation of this system increases blood vessel constriction, which can contribute to arterial stiffness. Vitamin D also can suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, activation of garbage-eating macrophages and calcification formation, all of which can thicken blood vessel walls and hinder flexibility. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed.\n\nNow it's time to do a larger-scale study, particularly in high-risk populations, and follow participants' progress for longer periods, Dong and Raed say. \"A year would give us even more data and ideas,\" Raed adds.\n\nDong notes that pulse wave velocity and blood pressure measures are complimentary but not interchangeable. \"We think maybe in the future, when you go to your physician, he or she might check your arterial stiffness as another indicator of how healthy you are,\" Raed says.\n\nThere were no measurable differences in weight or blood pressure measurements over the 16-week study period.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine currently recommends a daily intake of 800 IUs of vitamin D for those age 70 and older. For adolescents and adults, they recommend 4,000 IUs as the upper daily limit; 2,000 was a previous upper limit.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Americans, the majority of whom spend their days indoors, have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.

\u2014 BOSTON \u2013 (February 19, 2015) \u2013 In the first clinical trial directly comparing three drugs most commonly used to treat diabetic macular edema, researchers found all were effective in improving vision and preventing vision loss. However, one drug, aflibercept, provided greater improvement for people with more severe vision loss when treatment was initiated. The trial was conducted by the National Eye Institute Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) including researchers from Joslin Diabetes Center. The results appeared in the February online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDiabetes is a significant risk factor for developing eye diseases. The most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness is diabetic retinopathy, which is caused by elevated blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels of the retina and affects approximately 7.7 million Americans. About 750,000 Americans with diabetic retinopathy have diabetic macular edema (DME) in which fluid leaks into the macula, the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The fluid causes the macula to swell, blurring vision. \u201cDME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in working-age adults with diabetes. With the rate of diabetes increasing dramatically worldwide, many individuals will be at risk for vision loss from diabetic eye complications and DME is a major global health concern,\u201d says Jennifer K. Sun, M.D., M.P.H., a member of the study research team and writing committee, and an Investigator in the Section on Vascular Biology, an ophthalmologist in Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin and an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nIn an earlier study, Joslin researchers reported that VEGF, a major growth factor for blood vessels, is elevated in the eye fluids of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and DME, causing leakage and the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Over the past few years, drugs that target VEGF have become a standard treatment for DME, providing a preferred alternative or adjunct to laser treatment. The standard Medicare per-injection costs of the three anti-VEGF drugs evaluated in the study are about $1960 for aflibercept (Eylea), $1200 for ranibizumab (Lucentis) and $70 for bevacizumab (Avastin).\n\nAt the start of the trial, 660 adults with DME were enrolled: their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes. About half of the participants had 20/32 or 20/40 vision and the other half had vision of 20/50 or worse. They were randomized into three treatment groups and received the assigned study drug by injection into the eye until the DME resolved or stabilized. Participants on bevacizumab and ranibizumab received, on average, 10 injections, versus nine for those on aflibercept.\n\nOne year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. Those with mild vision loss (20/32 to 20/40) at baseline in all three treatment groups gained on average almost two lines on an eye chart. For participants with more severe vision loss (20/50 or worse), aflibercept improved vision on average nearly four lines, bevacizumab about 2.5 lines, and ranibizumab almost three lines.\n\n\u201cThe results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs\u2019 efficacy in treating DME.

Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while.\n\nIn a Manhattan office building on a recent evening, two dozen women \u2014 all in their 30s and 40s \u2014 sit in folding chairs, balancing cellphones and glasses of wine. They're gathered for a seminar called \"Take Control of Your Fertility.\"\n\nDr. Alan Copperman of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York wastes no time laying out this harsh reality: By the time a woman hits her 40s, 90 percent of her eggs are abnormal. The chances of a typical 40-year-old getting pregnant in any given month? Ten percent. Unless, that is, she gets pregnant with her younger eggs \u2014 eggs she had frozen years before.\n\nCopperman explains the procedure, introduces someone who has gone through it and takes a flurry of questions.\n\nAfterward, women crowd a counter to set up appointments with Copperman's clinic, which offers egg freezing. Sally Montgomery is among the youngest here, and the most upbeat. Her mom had trouble conceiving, so she wants to be proactive.\n\n\"I'm 31, your typical New Yorker,\" she says. \"I'm single, I'm bouncing around, and I'd like the opportunity to have a family, so I just figured, 'Why not?' I don't think it's a guarantee, but it's a nice insurance policy, and I think it takes some of the pressure off.\"\n\nOthers, though, slip out quietly. One 40-year-old says she wishes she'd learned about egg freezing earlier. Esther Montoro, a 37-year-old photographer, looks a little stunned.\n\n\"I think it's fantastic,\" she says, \"but I think it's so incredibly expensive.\"\n\nThe whole process \u2014 a week of hormones, plus the procedure to collect the eggs \u2014 runs $12,000 to $14,000. And because it takes 10 to 20 eggs for a reasonable shot at success, some may need to do this several times. Plus, there are annual storage fees. Then, when you're ready to use your eggs, you'll need in vitro fertilization, another pricey procedure. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have.\n\n\"I guess there's a big assumption that most women that need to do this [are] career, successful, rich women,\" she says. \"And I'm not!\"\n\nIn his office later, Copperman empathizes and says he hopes the procedure eventually becomes easier and cheaper. Still, he says, freezing eggs offers many women the biggest game changer since the birth control pill 50 years ago.\n\n\"Women began to have reproductive choices,\" he says. \"They got to decide when not to get pregnant. This technology has the potential to help women decide when they can get pregnant.\"\n\nClinics in the U.S. have long frozen fertilized eggs, or embryos. But eggs alone are more delicate and prone to damage. Over the years, egg freezing has been offered mainly to cancer patients facing radiation, but success rates were pretty dismal. Of late, though, the technology has exploded thanks to scientific leaps, including a flash-freeze method called vitrification.\n\nIn Copperman's lab, you can hear the sizzle as a tiny tube is plunged into liquid nitrogen.\n\n\"Snap freeze, snap thaw,\" he says. \"And what's really impressive is that when it comes out, it comes out looking just like it went in.\"\n\nIronically, much of this research was pioneered in Italy and Spain, where Catholic influence discouraged the creation of too many embryos, leaving fertility researchers with unused eggs instead.\n\nWith the better survival rate from vitrification and other new freezing methods, more and more clinics are now offering what they call \"fertility preservation.\" Meanwhile, the early adopters are starting to come back and use their eggs.\n\nIn a New York high rise, 8-month-old Camden squeals in delight as she bounces in her walker. She's here thanks to eggs her mom froze several years ago.\n\n\"My best friend and I made a pact together that at age 38, if we were both still single, we were going to have a child on our own,\" says Robyn Ross.\n\nWhen that time came, Ross decided she wasn't ready for single motherhood. Instead, she froze 14 eggs. Within a year, she fell in love and soon got married.\n\nHer husband, Mark Cohen, says he wasn't at all put off by the fact that his new love had her eggs in the freezer. As it turned out, his sperm was weakened by earlier cancer treatment, so conceiving their baby in a lab was the perfect solution.\n\n\"And this is our miracle baby,\" Cohen says, planting a kiss on Camden. \"We are one little happy family.\"\n\nRoss has already evangelized to her younger sister.\n\n\"I made her promise me that if she's still single by the age of 32, she would freeze her eggs,\" she says. \"The younger the better.\"\n\nNow, before you run out to a fertility clinic, there is a big note of caution. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, which sets industry guidelines, still considers egg freezing experimental.\n\n\"If the question were just, 'Does egg freezing and thawing work to achieve a pregnancy?' I think we're close,\" says Dr. Eric Widra, a member of the society's executive council.\n\nBut only 1,000 to 2,000 babies in the world have been born using frozen eggs. So far, they're fine \u2014 no abnormalities. Still, Widra would like a larger-scale, longer-term track record. It's not clear when \u2014 or if \u2014 a big-scale study might happen. But Widra says women need to understand that success rates will never be 100 percent.\n\n\"It's an insurance policy that you may or may not actually ever need,\" he says. \"And it's an insurance policy that if you do need, may not pay out.\"\n\nAnd yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. At Shady Grove Fertility, the Washington, D.C., clinic where he practices, he offers it to his own patients.\n\nThe Challenge Of Setting An Age Limit\n\nIt's quite a concept: Put your eggs in deep freeze and disconnect from that nagging biological clock. But, until when? How old is too old to use your younger eggs?\n\n\"There should be guidelines, I think, that are more clearly defined,\" says Dr. Geoffrey Sher, who heads the Sher Institutes for Reproductive Medicine and is based in Las Vegas.\n\nHe says many clinics suggest a cutoff of 50, the average age of menopause. After that, pregnancy can be riskier, and the large age gap raises complicated social issues. But the limit is tricky to impose. Sher remembers one couple who wanted to use donor eggs to conceive. The husband was 45, his wife, 55. Sher hesitated.\n\n\"And she said, 'That's discriminatory. If my husband was my age and I was his age, you wouldn't hesitate.' And she had a point,\" Sher says.\n\nThe woman was healthy. And the uterus doesn't decline like eggs do; in some cases, it can actually be coaxed back into working order. Sher's ethics board said OK.\n\n\"And she went ahead and had a baby at 57 years of age without any problems whatsoever,\" Sher says. \"I get a postcard from them at Christmas every year.\"\n\nThe bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women \u2014 getting them to take action before it's too late. They envision a time when society considers freezing eggs an act not of desperation but of empowerment.\n\nThis story was produced for broadcast by Marisa Penaloza.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story includes the high price tag for freezing eggs and the possibility that a family may need more than a single \u201cfreezing.\u201d\u00a0The story quotes about $40,000 for a safe number of eggs in storage and seems to imply that price includes the in- vitro fertilization required.

But for the first time, scientists are poised to bring to the US market a virus that can help thwart cancer, a development that could herald a new age of viral therapies.\n\nApproved by the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday for treating advanced-stage melanoma, the virus \u2014 called Imlygic, which was developed in part in a Massachusetts lab \u2014 is a modified version of the herpes virus that both attacks the cancer and sparks the immune system into action against tumors.\n\nIn clinical trials, it has helped some cancer patients achieve remission with few of the nasty side effects common to existing treatments. And as the first tumor-killing virus to receive the FDA\u2019s blessing, Imlygic could accelerate the development of other viral therapies.\n\n\u201cThis is huge for the whole field, and for cancer patients,\u201d said John Bell, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. \u201cThe field is exploding, and this would be another arrow in the quiver that oncologists use.\u201d\n\nImlygic is part of a new group of immune-stimulating viral therapies that could change how cancer is treated and managed. One involves a genetically tweaked poliovirus being tested in patients with brain tumors, while another, based on a version of the common cold virus, is now under evaluation in people with bladder cancer.\n\nMelanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that kills around 10,000 people per year in the United States. In a trial of 436 patients with the disease, 16 percent of participants who received Imlygic saw their tumors shrink for at least six months, compared with just 2 percent of those who received an older immune-boosting drug. Among those whose cancer had spread locally but not to internal organs, the response rate was better \u2014 33 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a low-toxicity treatment, and for the right patients you see quite stunning results,\u201d said Robert Coffin, a virologist who created Imlygic at BioVex, the Woburn-based company he founded.\n\nIn 2011, the California biotech giant Amgen bought BioVex \u2014 and the rights to Imlygic, known generically as talimogene laherparepvec, or T-VEC \u2014 in a deal worth up to $1 billion. Amgen will charge patients $65,000 for a course of treatment, which analysts said is in line with expectations.\n\n\u201cThese days in oncology we\u2019ve seen some prices quite a bit higher than that,\u201d said Eric Schmidt, an analyst with Cowen & Company. \u201cAnd Amgen\u2019s not a company that likes to price gouge.\u201d\n\nSchmidt said Imlygic\u2019s market potential as a standalone drug is \u201cvery, very modest. It\u2019s being developed in combination with other immunotherapies, where we think there\u2019s a little more of a commercial opportunity, but we still need to see more data.\u201d\n\nImlygic is approved for skin tumors that are inoperable in patients whose cancer has returned following surgery.\n\nSue Bohlin, a retired small-business owner in Farmingdale, N.J., is one of those patients. She received the viral therapy in early 2011 after conventional treatments failed to eliminate the skin tumors that had spread from her back to her breast.\n\n\u201cThe first time I took it, I got a really serious case of the chills and a high fever, but only for six or eight hours,\u201d said Bohlin, now 62. \u201cAfter that, there were no side effects.\u201d\n\nSuch muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach, doctors and patients said. Aside from chills and fever, the other common symptom cited in the study was skin irritation.\n\nBohlin\u2019s doctors planned to inject each of her tumor sites every two weeks, but after several rounds of treatments more tumors appeared. In a last-ditch effort meant to jump-start Bohlin\u2019s immune system, they injected her on consecutive weeks.

research presented at the ATS 2016 International Conference.\n\nThe test, known as C-Tb, combines the \"field friendliness of the PPD-based tuberculin skin test with the high specificity of interferon gamma release assays, or IGRAs,\" said lead researcher Morten Ruhwald, MD, PhD, head of human immunology at Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, which developed the test.\n\nThe new test measures the body's immune response to two TB antigens, EAST-6 and CFP10. The test is administered like a tuberculin skin test (TST), and results are interpreted by measuring the size of the skin induration two or three days later.\n\nThe TST is the most commonly used test to detect TB infection, with about 50 million tests worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The test is easy to administer but produces too many false positives to achieve the WHO's goal of reducing TB deaths by 95 percent and new cases by 90 percent by 2035, Dr. Ruhwald said.\n\nIntroduced a decade ago, IGRAs have high specificity, producing few false positives, but require blood samples and complicated lab work, which has limited their widespread use. There is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests. According to Dr. Ruhwald, a TST costs about $2; an IGRA is 20 to 40 times more expensive depending on setting.\n\nIn the first clinical trial, Dr. Ruhwald and colleagues conducted a double-blinded study of C-Tb in 979 participants enrolled at 13 clinical trial sites in Spain. Participants, all adults, ranged in TB status from presumed uninfected through intermediate and high risk of latent TB to active disease.\n\u2022 Both C-Tb and the IGRA had a specificity of 97 percent.\n\u2022 C-Tb was highly concordant to IGRA in 95 percent of study participants.\n\u2022 The specificity of C-Tb, unlike the TST, was not impacted by the BCG vaccine, the partially effective vaccine that many residents in the developing world receive. TST specificity in this group was only 62 percent.\n\u2022 The sensitivity of C-Tb was comparable to the IGRA in confirmed TB cases (77 percent vs. 81 percent), indicating similar abilities to detect infection.\n\nIn the second double-blinded trial, researchers were primarily concerned with testing how accurate C-Tb was in HIV-positive patients and in young children--populations in which the accuracy of the TST and the IGRA is known to be compromised. The study, conducted in South Africa, enrolled 1,090 participants, including 299 patients with HIV and 402 children as young as 28 days.\n\u2022 Among participants with HIV, the ability of all three tests to detect TB infection was diminished, though the C-Tb appeared more robust in HIV-infected participants with low CD4 T cell counts.\n\u2022 Among children under 5, C-Tb was comparable with the other two tests in identifying those infected.\n\nDr. Ruhwald said another advantage of C-Tb is that the measurement of infection, a 5mm or larger induration, is universal across patients with different risk factors, including HIV infection. With TST, the size of the induration is often adjusted to increase its accuracy in measuring infection in different patient populations.\n\nRegulatory approval for C-Tb is currently being sought and Statens Serum Institute is actively seeking a commercial partner for marketing of C-Tb. The cost of a C-Tb test is to be determined; however, it is expected to be significantly less than an IGRA.\n\nDiagnostic Accuracy of the Novel C-Tb Skin Test for Latent M.tuberculosis Infection; Results from Two Phase III Clinical Trials \n\nM.

C-Tb combines the field friendliness of the PPD-based Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), with the high specificity of the interferon gamma release assays (IGRA).\n\nThis presentation outlines the results from two recently completed phase III trials (TESEC-05 and -06). The results have not previously been published or presented.\n\nThe TESEC-06 trial included 979 participants from 13 clinical trial sites in Catalonia, Galicia and Basque Country (Spain) with various risk profiles of M.tuberculosis infection. The TESEC-05 trial included 1090 participants with symptoms of TB and 100 endemic controls from Cape Town (South Africa).\n\nIn both trials C-Tb and TST were administered in a double-blinded fashion to one or the other forearm. Skin indurations were read 2 to 3 days later. A reading ?5mm was considered positive for the TST and C-Tb (cut off preset in phase II). Blood for IGRA testing (Quantiferon, QFT-GIT) was drawn prior to skin testing.\n\nThe safety profile of C-Tb was acceptable and not different from TST. Test specificity was assessed in 212 presumed unexposed Spanish controls. Here, C-Tb had comparable specificity to QFT-GIT (both 97%, p=1.0, and there was no impact of BCG vaccination). By contrast, previous BCG vaccination subverted TST specificity [62% (67/108) in BCG vaccinated compared to 95% (99/104) in BCG unvaccinated persons; (p<0.001)]. Sensitivity of C-Tb and QFT-GIT was comparable in patients with confirmed TB [77% (235/307) vs 81% (250/307); p=0.08]. In contacts, mirroring the findings with QFT-GIT, there was a strong trend in increasing C-Tb test positivity with M. tuberculosis exposure (figure 1). The impact of age and HIV infection on C-Tb, TST and QFT reactivity was assessed in 1090 individuals with symptoms suspect of TB disease, analysis is ongoing and will be included in the presentation.\n\nThese phase III trial results demonstrate that C-Tb is safe, has comparable diagnostic performance to QFT-GIT and addresses the problem of false positive TST results in BCG vaccinated persons.\n\nThe field-friendliness and high specificity offered by the C-Tb test could allow for improved targeted treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected persons in also in resource-constrained settings, where IGRAs are too complicated to implement.", "question": "Does the news release adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "This release provides a very good discussion of costs, stating, \u201cThere is also a dramatic price difference between the two diagnostic tests.

Mothers don't see the procedure and their babies are immediately whisked away for pediatric care \u2014 a separation that can last for close to half an hour. Kristen Caminiti, of Crofton, Md., knows this routine well. Her first two sons were born by traditional cesarean. She was happy with their births because, she says, it was all she knew. Then, just a few weeks into her third pregnancy, Caminiti, who is 33, saw a post on Facebook about family-centered cesarean techniques catching on in England.\n\n\"I clicked on the link and thought, 'I want that,' \" she says.\n\nThe techniques are relatively easy and the main goals simple: Let moms see their babies being born if they want and put newborns immediately on the mother's chest for skin-to-skin contact. This helps stimulate bonding and breast feeding. Caminiti asked her obstetrician, Dr. Marcus Penn, if he'd allow her to have this kind of birth. He said yes.\n\nWhen Caminiti told Penn what she wanted, his first thought was it wouldn't be that difficult to do. \"I didn't see anything that would be terribly out of the norm,\" he says. \"It would be different from the way we usually do it, but nothing terrible that anyone would say we shouldn't try that.\"\n\nFamily-centered cesareans are a relatively new idea in the U.S., and many doctors and hospitals have no experience with them. Penn and the staff at Anne Arundel Medical Center quickly realized the procedure would require some changes, including adding a nurse and bringing the neonatal team into the operating room.\n\nAnd there were a bunch of little adjustments, such as moving the EKG monitors from their usual location on top of the mother's chest to her side. This allows the delivery team to place the newborn baby immediately on the mother's chest. In addition, Penn says, the mother's hands were not strapped down and the intravenous line was put in her nondominant hand so she could hold the baby.\n\nAt the beginning of October, Caminiti underwent her C-section. She was alert, her head was up and the drape lowered so she could watch the delivery of her son, Connor. Caminiti's husband, Matt, recorded the event. After Connor was out, with umbilical cord still attached, he was placed right on Caminiti's chest.\n\n\"It was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest,\" Caminiti says. \"He was screaming and then I remember that when I started to talk to him he stopped. It was awesome.\"\n\nAnd the baby stayed with her for the rest of the procedure.\n\nChanges like this can make a big difference, says Dr. William Camann, the director of obstetric anesthesiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the pioneers of the procedure in the U.S. At Brigham and Women's, their version of the family-centered cesarean is called the gentle cesarean. Moms who opt for it can view the birth through a clear plastic drape, and immediate skin-to-skin contact follows.\n\nCamann says the gentle C-section is not a replacement for a vaginal birth; it's just a way to improve the surgical experience. \"No one is trying to advocate for C-sections.

Betsey Snow of Anne Arundel Medical Center says the family-centered C-section represents a cultural shift, and her hospital is helping break new ground by adopting it.\n\n\"It is the first time we have really done anything innovative or creative with changing the C-section procedure in years,\" she says.\n\nKristen Caminiti says her hope is that these innovations become routine.

This study -- which is the first to suggest that the reduction in risk occurs for low-dose aspirin -- was proposed by City of Hope's Leslie Bernstein, Ph.D., professor and director of the Division of Biomarkers of Early Detection and Prevention, and published online in the journal, Breast Cancer Research.\n\nBernstein and her colleagues saw an overall 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer in women who reported using low-dose aspirin at least three times per week. Such regular use of low-dose aspirin reduced the risk by 20 percent of estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, which is the most common breast cancer subtype.\n\n\"The study found an interesting protective association between low-dose aspirin and breast cancer,\" said lead author Christina A.

The study was also published online yesterday by The New England Journal of Medicine and will appear in the Dec. 7 issue.\n\nHer report is the latest warning from researchers who suspect that stents are being overused and may even be causing heart attacks and deaths. Manufacturers sell $6 billion in stents a year, and hospitals charge $10,000 to $15,000 per patient to implant them.\n\nThe devices, which came into widespread use in the 1990s, are made of either bare metal or metal coated with a drug meant to help keep the artery from closing again. Recent studies have found that drug-coated stents can increase the risk of blood clots, even years after they are implanted.\n\nUse of the drug-coated stents has fallen since last spring, but they still account for more than 80 percent of stents implanted in the United States.\n\nStents have been increasingly used in people with clogged arteries who are not having heart attacks, but some studies suggest that those patients would be better off taking drugs to reduce cholesterol, inflammation and clotting. The reasoning is that artery disease tends to be systemic and extensive, but stents can treat it only in tiny spots.\n\nA million Americans a year have heart attacks, and half of them die, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. A common symptom is severe pain in the chest, left arm, jaw or back, but about a third of patients do not have chest pain. Symptoms may also include feeling faint, sweaty, short of breath or nauseated and having a sensation that the heart is pounding.\n\nClots are often the cause of heart attacks, and health authorities urge people with symptoms to go to the hospital immediately so that doctors can use balloons and stents, or clot-dissolving drugs, to try to prevent heart damage. But some patients do not realize what is happening, or do not want to believe it.\n\nAbout a million angioplasties a year are performed in the United States, including those in heart attack victims and those in people with blocked arteries who have not had heart attacks. The study did not address the use of angioplasty and stents in people who have not had heart attacks.\n\nDr. Hochman emphasized that angioplasty was still the best treatment for many heart attack patients who go to the hospital early, within 12 hours of when the attack began. The people who generally do best are those who arrive at the hospital and have angioplasty within 90 minutes of the heart attack.\n\nOpening a clogged artery in the early stages of a heart attack \u2014 \u201cearly angioplasty\u201d \u2014 can restore blood flow and reduce damage to the heart muscle. It can sometimes save the muscle after 12 hours, but then doctors decide case by case whether it is worthwhile. About a third of heart attack patients show up after 12 hours.\n\nAfter a few days have passed, though, there is little or no chance of preventing heart damage. But many doctors open the artery anyway, thinking it may still have long-term benefits and prolong the patients\u2019 lives. In that situation, the procedure is called late angioplasty. It can be helpful in people who are still suffering from chest pain or have certain other complications from the heart attack.\n\nBut what about people who see a doctor more than a day later and are medically stable and free of chest pain? The new study tried to determine if late angioplasty could help them. Although angioplasty is not open surgery, it is an invasive procedure with risks, and the researchers wanted to know if there was any reason to put these patients through it when they seemed to be on the road to recovery. The study showed there was no need for the procedure.\n\nThe findings may come as a rude surprise to many cardiologists, who have come to believe that opening a blocked artery, even days or weeks after a heart attack, is bound to be good for patients.\n\nEven Dr. Hochman was surprised by the results. She said she and her colleagues expected to find that angioplasty would reduce the risks of heart failure, subsequent heart attacks and death. But their theory failed the test.\n\n\u201cThis is why we have clinical trials,\u201d she said. She added that cardiologists were such strong believers in angioplasty that some major medical centers in the United States and Europe had refused to participate in her study, saying it would be unethical to let some patients go without the procedure for a study.\n\nThe 2,166 patients in the study had all suffered heart attacks 3 to 28 days before, caused by a completely blocked coronary artery. The median time since the heart attack was eight days. They were in stable condition and free of chest pain, and were picked at random to receive either heart medicines only or balloon treatment and stents with heart medicines.

The device is approved only for dermatologists and only for use on growths that don't have obvious signs of cancer but still have one or two worrisome traits.\n\nThe hope is to find more melanomas sooner. Nearly all patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma can be treated and cured, but 85 percent of patients with late-stage melanoma die from it within five years.\n\nMore than 70,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, and 16 percent are diagnosed only after the disease has spread to other parts of the body, according to estimates from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTo diagnose the disease, doctors decide which moles to remove and biopsy using an entirely visual set of guidelines involving size, shape and color. Most dermatologists easily spot late-stage lesions that have obvious signs of cancer, including irregular edges, uneven color and a width greater than 6 millimeters. But many others are tough calls.\n\n\"Every day patients come in with 20 moles on their back and the dilemma is, which ones are suspicious and need to be biopsied?\" said Dr. David Pariser, former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. \"The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it,\" said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA.\n\nThe device's handheld attachment, about the size of a blow dryer, emits light that penetrates below the surface of the skin, taking multicolored images that reflect the depth and shape of skin growths. A computer compares these to a database of 10,000 archived images and recommends whether a biopsy should be done.\n\nIn a company-sponsored study published last year involving around 1,300 patients, some with multiple growths, doctors reported that MelaFind correctly suggested biopsies on 125 of 127 melanomas that doctors had removed. MelaFind correctly identified about 10 percent of non-cancerous growths, which was better than doctors in the study who were correct less than 4 percent of the time, on average. The study was published in the Archives of Dermatology.\n\nThe company's study was not intended to show that screening with the device saves lives, only that it can help improve a doctor's ability to spot melanoma.\n\nFor now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove.\n\n\"There is no such thing as 100 percent certainty in medicine,\" said Dr. George Elias, a melanoma expert at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center who had no ties to the company or the device.\n\n\"Ultimately it's the responsibility of the dermatologist to use his clinical judgment to make the best decision. This machine is there to help him, not replace him.\"\n\nElias voted with the majority of an FDA panel that narrowly endorsed the device last year.\n\nDermatologists say it's too early to tell whether MelaFind will lead to fewer unnecessary biopsies.\n\n\"A biopsy takes a few minutes in my hands, so if there's an issue with any lesion we will always biopsy, whether we have a MelaFind picture or not,\" said Dr. Leonard Goldberg, a dermatologist at the Texas Medical Center and vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, a disease awareness group that accepts donations from makers of sunscreen.\n\nMelaFind underwent a contentious, years-long review by the Food and Drug Administration, which initially rejected the device and concluded it could \"potentially cause more harm than good.\"\n\nRegulators worried that the device could give physicians a false sense of certainty, leading to fewer biopsies. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. About 8 percent of growths scanned in the company study came back as \"unevaluable.\"\n\nAt a meeting last fall, FDA scientists said Mela Sciences had not shown how its device would influence day-to-day decisions by doctors. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles. Despite these concerns, the panel of advisers narrowly backed the overall safety and efficacy of the device in a 8-7 vote.\n\nRegulators said this week that they ultimately approved the device after Mela Sciences agreed to limit its use to board-certified dermatologists who undergo a specialized training course.\n\n\"The device is only good for certain lesions, and that's why you have to be a dermatologist to be able to classify and categorize those lesions appropriately,\" said Christy Foreman, director of FDA's Office of Device Evaluation.\n\nForeman said an FDA-required follow-up study would help determine how much of a benefit MelaFind represents for patients.\n\n\"This device represents new technology. At the end of the day I don't know that this will be the best technology out there, but it is a step forward to allow continued innovation in this area,\" Foreman said.\n\nDon't expect to see a MelaFind machine at your next doctor's appointment. The company plans to bring them next year to just 200 dermatologists on the East coast, all of whom must undergo company training before they can begin using the device.\n\nDoctors will pay a one-time fee of $7,500 to lease and receive training on the device.

"id": 1010, "category": "Question 1", "annotations": []}, {"article": "Gone With A Shot? Hopeful New Signs Of Relief For Migraine Sufferers\n\nHumans have suffered from migraines for millennia. Yet, despite decades of research, there isn't a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. All of that could change in a few months when the Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce its decision about new therapies that have the potential to turn migraine treatment on its head.\n\nThe new therapies are based on research begun in the 1980s showing that people in the throes of a migraine attack have high levels of a protein called calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide, or CGRP, in their blood.\n\nStep by step, researchers tracked and studied this neurochemical's effects. They found that injecting the peptide into the blood of people prone to migraines triggers migraine-like headaches, whereas people not prone to migraines experienced, at most, mild pain. Blocking transmission of CGRP in mice appeared to prevent migraine-like symptoms. And so a few companies started developing a pill that might do the same in humans.\n\nClinical trials of the first pills were effective against migraine but halted in 2011 over concerns about potential liver damage. So, four pharmaceutical companies rejiggered their approach. To bypass the liver, all four instead looked to an injectable therapy called monoclonal antibodies \u2014 tiny immune molecules most commonly used to treat cancer. Not only do these bypass the liver to block CGRP, but one injection appears to be effective for up to three months with almost no noticeable side effects.\n\nTwo manufacturers, Amgen (in collaboration with Novartis) and Teva Pharmaceuticals, have completed clinical trials and expect to hear from the FDA by June whether the therapies have been approved. Two more companies, Eli Lilly and Alder Biopharmaceuticals, plan to file for FDA approval later this year.\n\nIt's been a long time coming. Right now, the only available preventive treatments are accidental discoveries: A number of people prescribed medications for depression, high blood pressure and epilepsy discovered migraine relief, too. Now, many of those drugs, including propranolol and topiramate, have been tested and approved for migraine. But no one drug works for everyone, and side effects can prove intolerable or downright unpleasant.\n\nMigraines are throbbing, one-sided headaches that can be accompanied by nausea as well as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, and movement. At their best, the headaches are an annoyance. At their worst, they can be completely debilitating. So for those of us who get numerous migraines each month, the prospect of a new approach feels almost life-changing.\n\nAccording to one recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women in the U.S. reported having had a migraine in the last three months. And up to 2 percent of all Americans has at least 15 migraine days every single month. The toll such pain can take on health, morale, and productivity is substantial.\n\nMy own migraines started when I was 13. They struck a few times a week and I thought they were normal headaches. For a while, I tried the usual over the counter pain relievers but, one by one, they stopped working. By age 25, I started to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with my head. My general practitioner diagnosed me with migraines, gave me my first preventive medication \u2014 an antidepressant \u2014 then sent me to see a specialist.\n\nSince that day more than 17 years ago, I have tried six preventive prescription medications. Not one helped. I alternated among four different, neurologist-recommended supplements, all to no avail. I received bi-monthly injections of magnesium and participated in one of the first clinical trials of Botox. And while Botox seemed to decrease my migraines by one or two per month, it wasn't enough to bother fighting about it with a new insurance company. I exercised regularly. I experimented with an elimination diet that left me eating nothing but broccoli and white rice, but still the migraines came. I averaged about 15 to 20 each month.\n\nStill, I considered myself lucky. The headaches almost never came with nausea, and I had medications that typically ousted them within an hour or two. All told, I usually lost only a few hours of productivity a week.\n\nWhen I grew older and had two children, my body changed and my migraines changed, too. I get them less frequently now, but when they come, they can stick around for a few days or even a week. Abortive medications still work, except when they don't. So when I heard about a new approach that was making its way through a number of pharmaceutical company pipelines, I began combing through the national clinical trials database to find a trial near me. I found one about 80 miles away, which didn't seem too far a trek considering the tantalizing reward of a migraine-free life. I made an appointment.\n\nNeurologist David Dodick, at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, has been involved in multiple clinical trials with each of the four anti-CGRP antibody treatments in development. And, he admits, he's optimistic. He has good reason to be: Each of the therapies decreases migraine frequency by at least one to two days per month. \"In a field where, over time, the progress and pace of research in understanding the underlying biology and mechanism of disease has been slow, this was very exciting,\" he says.\n\nBecause migraines are not life-threatening, most drugs have to pass a pretty high bar to be approved. And so far, patients on the experimental treatments report limited side effects that consist mostly of pain at the injection site. Unlike the current preventive medications, there is no nausea, no fuzzy thinking, no nerve pain, no weight loss or gain. And instead of remembering to take a daily pill, there is just a once-monthly injection.\n\nNeurologists already have patients eager to test these therapies, especially when everything else they've tried hasn't worked. \"There's a big hole to fill, both in prevention and acute therapies,\" says Alexander Mauskop, director of the New York Headache Center in New York City. (Disclosure: He's my former neurologist.) \"If I have someone who's really suffering and can't find a solution, I tell them that in June I might have something new for them to try.\" Right now, he says, he has a list of about two dozen such patients.\n\nEven if the new therapies are approved, however, patients may still have to jump through a number of hoops to get them. Biologic therapies like these are expensive, and treatment could reportedly range anywhere from $8,000 to $18,000 a year. At that price, Mauskop and other neurologists expect insurance companies to require patients to have tried just about everything else first.\n\nThe other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. \"If someone is well-controlled with Botox or another drug, I'd not suggest they switch,\" Mauskop says. \"With Vioxx, it took 10 years before they discovered that it increased the risk of heart problems.\"\n\nSide effects are a potential concern. Elizabeth Loder, chief of headache at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, points out that because CGRP constricts blood vessels, there may be potential long-term effects on blood pressure or other cardiovascular function. In women of childbearing age, who are the ones most prone to frequent migraines, \"you can imagine that might have effects on fertility or placental function.\"\n\nRight now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.\n\nI ask Mauskop whether he'd recommend I enroll in a clinical trial, given my failure to respond to most everything else. He pauses, noting that he's no longer my neurologist and that he can't really give me any suggestions. But then he says that, since I'd previously shown some response to Botox, perhaps I might want to give it another try. I think about my two young children and my risk tolerance. Perhaps in 10 years I'll feel differently. For now, however, I pick up the phone and cancel my clinical trial appointment.\n\nLauren Gravitz is a science writer and editor in Hershey, Penn.

And while mice are different from humans in many ways, their immune systems are quite similar.\n\n\u201cIf this works, it is going to be absolutely fantastic,\u201d said Bill Heetderks, who directs outside research at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, part of the National Institutes of Health, which helped pay for the research. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s going to be another step down the road.\u201d\n\nIn autoimmune disease, the body\u2019s immune cells mistakenly attack and destroy healthy tissue. In MS, it\u2019s the fatty protective sheath around the nerves; in type-1 or juvenile diabetes it\u2019s cells in the pancreas that make insulin; in rheumatoid arthritis it\u2019s tissue in the joint.\n\nCurrently, the main treatment is to suppress the immune system, an approach that can leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer. The new treatment re-educates the immune cells so they stop the attacks.\n\nThe approach uses tiny little balls called nanoparticles made of the same material used to make surgical sutures that dissolve harmlessly in the body. They\u2019re attached to little bits of the protein that the immune cells are attacking, the researchers report in Sunday\u2019s issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology.\n\nStephen Miller of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago had been trying a slightly different approach to treating MS. When normal cells die naturally through a self-destruction process called apoptosis, immune cells called macrophages come in and eat up the mess.\n\nThe macrophages are carried to the spleen where they show these ground-up bits of cells to other immune cells called T-cells. It\u2019s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the T-cells with the body\u2019s normal cells. Then T-cells know not to attack healthy cells.\n\nMiller\u2019s team had been trying to find ways to use this process to re-educate the T-cells. They have been attaching bits of the myelin that T-cells mistakenly attack to healthy cells from MS patients that were self-destructing, then infusing the concoction back into MS patients.\n\nThe idea would be to \u201cintroduce\u201d the myelin to the T-cells at the same time they were \u201cmeeting\u201d the healthy tissue, and educate them to leave the myelin alone.\n\nSo far the team has only shown the process is safe \u2013 a phase 1 clinical trial. But Miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients\u2019 immune systems. However, it was hideously expensive. \u201cIt cost probably about a million dollars to treat 10 patients using live cells,\u201d he said.\n\nObviously, the researchers needed something cheaper. Miller got together with Lonnie Shea, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern. They substituted cheap little balls of plastic called polystyrene nanoparticles for the self-destructing cells.\n\nThese new nanoparticles stopped the course of a MS-like disease in mice, the researchers found. But polystyrene is no good to use in people. It doesn\u2019t break down and contains a compound, styrene, that may cause cancer.\n\nShea had another possibility, called poly(lactide-co-glycolide) or PLG for short. \u201cIt turns out this is an FDA approved substance that is used in resorbable sutures,\u201d said Miller.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing rare or exotic or strange here,\u201d said NIBIB\u2019s Heetderks. The particles are easy to produce, he said.\n\nThis worked just as well in mice. It only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of PLG. When infused into a vein, they\u2019re carried by the blood right to the spleen, where the nanoparticles \u201cmeet\u201d the T-cells.\n\nIf the treatment was done as soon as the mice had their first MS-like attack, the attacks stopped. The effects lasted for the entire lives of the mice, Miller said.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about the approach, Miller says, is that it can be used to treat any autoimmune disease. For diabetes, little bits of pancreatic beta cells could be attached to the nanoparticles. For a food allergy, the part of the food that causes the allergic response could be attached. \u201cYou can try to induce tolerance to peanuts or eggs or shellfish or whatever you are allergic to,\u201d he said.\n\nOne shortcoming is that scientists don\u2019t always know what\u2019s causing an autoimmune disease. \u201cWe know that in rheumatoid arthritis, your joints get attacked, but what we don\u2019t know really well is what specific protein in your joints is being attacked. We really need to know that before we can apply this therapy,\u201d Miller said.\n\nNow the researchers are looking for funding so they can test this new approach in people. They\u2019re in discussions with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to test it in people with type-1 diabetes, and the Myelin Repair Foundation to test it in MS patients, Miller said. They may form their own company to develop it as a medical treatment, something that would be years away.\n\nMice don\u2019t live very long, and it\u2019s not clear if human patients would need repeat treatments. But the T-cells that are re-educated usually live for a long time in the body, and have long memories, Miller said.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear the approach would not repair any damage already done by the disease, so the best candidates would be patients having their very first symptoms. But it might be possible down the road to combine the nanoparticle treatment with another treatment to replace the damaged tissue in more advanced patients, Miller said.\n\nNew drug may help MS", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story quotes a researcher saying that one stage of the research\u2026\u201dwas hideously expensive.\u201d \u2026 \u201cIt cost probably about a million dollars to treat 10 patients using live cells,\u201d he said.", "answer": 1, "paragraphs": ["Researchers trying to find a way to treat multiple sclerosis think they\u2019ve come up with an approach that could not only help patients with MS, but those with a range of so-called autoimmune diseases, from type-1 diabetes to psoriasis, and perhaps even food allergies.", "So far it\u2019s only worked in mice, but it has worked especially well.

About 800,000 people suffer a stroke each year, and about 130,000 die.\n\nNearly 90 percent of strokes occur when a clot blocks an artery in the brain, starving the region downstream of blood and oxygen. If flow isn\u2019t restored quickly, brain tissue and the functions it controls \u2014 movement, speech, cognition \u2014 are damaged or can die.\n\nOver the past 20 years, studies showed that if a person having a stroke gets a thrombolytic drug within three hours of when the symptoms start (4\u00bd hours for certain patients), the process can be reversed and a lifetime of disability avoided. Later than that, little is gained; the brain cells are too damaged to survive. In fact, giving the drugs too late can make matters worse. Uncontrolled bleeding can occur as the dying tissue breaks down.\n\nEarly observations suggested that approaching the clot with a catheter and either injecting clot-dissolving drugs into it or snagging it and pulling it out produced better results.

Half were then assigned to get an imaging study that looked at the arteries of the brain to see whether a blockage remained. If it did, the doctors went after it with an endovascular procedure. The other half of the patients got standard treatment, which didn\u2019t include the procedure. Forty-one percent of patients recovered completely in the endovascular group and 39 percent recovered completely in the control group, outcomes that were no different statistically.

At three months, 35 percent of the patients in the tPA group were alive without any disabilities, compared with 30 percent of the endovascular group. That also was not significantly different.\n\nThe third study, called MR RESCUE, run out of Georgetown University, was more complicated.\n\nIt randomly assigned 118 patients less than eight hours out from the start of their strokes to receive standard care or have the clot removed with a catheter device. They also got CAT or MRI scans to see whether they had a large or small amount of brain tissue still alive and salvageable.

treatment for as many as 4 million adults whose severe depression is not relieved by psychotherapy, drugs or even shock treatments.\n\nSince its approval under unusual circumstances eight months ago by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), more than 550 Americans have undergone surgery to have a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implanted in their chests to activate parts of their brains. Another 7,000 people -- aided by a network of nurses hired by Cyberonics, the Houston-based manufacturer of the device -- are seeking approval from their insurance companies for the $25,000 operation.\n\nMore than 3,700 psychiatrists, including doctors affiliated with Suburban, Georgetown, Sheppard Pratt and Howard University hospitals, have been trained in the use of VNS, the first device ever approved to treat depression. It consists of a battery-operated generator attached to an electrode implanted in the vagus nerve in the neck. The generator emits regular pulses of electricity that are supposed to stimulate serotonin and other brain chemicals believed to regulate mood, according to Cyberonics.\n\nYet despite the imprimatur of the FDA and an aggressive marketing campaign mounted by the company, the most basic question about the treatment remains unanswered: Does it work? Is VNS a lifesaving treatment for chronic depression, as some patients and doctors maintain, or an unproven and potentially harmful treatment based on flimsy science, as critics contend?\n\nAt the heart of the debate is this: The only rigorous clinical trial of the device -- which is approved to treat severe epilepsy -- failed to demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating depression. That study involved 235 patients, all of whom received the device, which was turned on in only half the group. At the end of three months, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.\n\nA second study of 174 VNS recipients found that 30 percent showed significant improvement after one year. Because that study lacked a control group and because patients received other depression treatments after the device was implanted, there is no way to know whether the device was responsible. For years experts have known that depression -- unlike, say, type 1 diabetes -- can get better without treatment.\n\nLast July, a top FDA official, citing the lack of alternatives for severely depressed patients, overruled unanimous opposition by 20 members of his staff and approved the device as a depression treatment for adults who had failed four other treatments.\n\nFDA spokesman Stephen King said that VNS met federal standards for medical devices, which are less stringent than those governing drugs, and might help adults who had exhausted other options and were at a high risk of suicide. Cyberonics officials testified that 30,000 people commit suicide annually, most of whom were diagnosed with severe depression. The same rationale had led an FDA advisory panel in 2004 to approve the device by a 5-2 vote.\n\nTo Philadelphia psychiatrist Richard P. Malone, a member of the panel who voted against approval, such arguments are specious.\n\n\"Pancreatic cancer is a hopeless condition\" with a much higher death rate than chronic depression, said Malone, a professor of psychiatry at Drexel University. \"And we have as much evidence that this works for pancreatic cancer as it does for depression. Why not use it for that?\"\n\nSome patients with chronic depression say they were willing to try anything that promised relief. Graphic artist Colleen Kelly decided in 2000 that she had nothing to lose by enrolling in an experimental study of VNS. Now 42, Kelly, who lives in Prince George's County, said dozens of medications had not helped her for long or had caused severe reactions. Nearly three dozen electroshock treatments failed to work and wiped out years of memories, she said.\n\nVNS gave Kelly three \"very good years,\" she said, and then her depression returned. \"The past year has been abysmal,\" said Kelly, who urged the FDA advisory panel to approve the device. \"I still keep hoping it's going to help me in some way.\"\n\nBut critics say they are not persuaded by Cyberonics's theory of how VNS works. The company's Web site says that \"preliminary imaging studies suggest that VNS Therapy affects many areas of the brain implicated in mood regulation.\"\n\nBut Malone called the theory \"all speculative.\"\n\n\"This almost has a feel of 18th-century psychiatry -- having a device and not being able to show how it works,\" he said.\n\nWashington psychiatrist Wayne Blackmon agreed. \"Psychiatry has been burned again and again by overextravagant claims\" about devices and psychosurgery, said Blackmon, a lawyer and a past president of the D.C. Medical Society. \"The history of psychiatry is plagued by psychiatrists jumping the gun because these poor people are suffering and the argument is we have to do something.\"\n\nThe device has also attracted attention on Capitol Hill, where the Senate Finance Committee has spent two years looking into decision-making at the FDA.\n\nLast month committee chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), whose panel issued a report highly critical of the agency's approval of VNS, said he was concerned that patients and their doctors were not being adequately informed about the risks of VNS, which include cardiovascular problems that can be life-threatening.\n\nGrassley questioned whether Medicare and Medicaid should pay for the device, which costs $15,000 and must be replaced every five years or so when the battery runs low. So far neither the federal government nor private insurers have agreed to cover VNS for depression on a routine basis, although many have approved individual cases.\n\nLast week, BlueCross BlueShield of Alabama announced it would pay for VNS treatment in chronically depressed patients who had failed four previous treatments.\n\nTwo recent technology assessments by major insurance companies have concluded there is insufficient evidence to find that VNS works for depression. A report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, an influential mental health insurer in Boston, called it \"experimental, investigational and unproven.\"\n\nRobert \"Skip\" Cummins, Cyberonics's CEO, dismissed such criticism and said his company, whose sole product is VNS, faced similar skepticism after the device was approved for epilepsy in 1997.\n\nHe noted that VNS is now accepted by insurers as a treatment for intractable seizures, which can be fatal if they are not controlled. About 35,000 epilepsy patients have received the implant.\n\nMany FDA \"regulators, politicians and third-party payers\" know little about resistant depression, Cummins said. \"Hundreds of psychiatric thought leaders and patients are rallying around the device\" for \"the worst of the worst\" cases of depression, he said.\n\n\"There is nothing out there as safe and effective,\" Cummins said, adding that a company-financed study showed that the effectiveness of VNS improved over time. He added that he has a personal interest in intractable depression because his mother and grandfather committed suicide.\n\nNew York psychiatrist T. Byram Karasu, chairman of the task force that writes the section on depression for psychiatry's diagnostic and statistical manual, said that even though the effectiveness of VNS is uncertain, it appeals to patients and their psychiatrists.\n\nIn its marketing campaign, Cyberonics notes that VNS treatment does not cause the weight gain associated with antidepressants and the confusion and memory loss common after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychiatry's term for shock treatments.\n\n\"VNS has a quality of cardiac surgery to it, a certain cachet,\" and it lacks the stigma of shock treatments, said Karasu, adding that six of his patients adamantly refused ECT and opted instead for VNS. \"No one would know you didn't get a defibrillator.\"\n\nFor Paulo Negro's patients, the issue is not stigma, but options. Negro, chief of behavioral health services at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, said his VNS patients have tried everything, but their depression always recurred.\n\n\"What would you do if you've not been getting better for years?\" asked Negro. \"It's a chance to get better. I'd take it.\"\n\nThat's what Charles E. Donovan III did. The St. Louis resident credits the implant he received five years ago with saving his life. At the time, the Georgetown University graduate said he was so depressed he told his doctor he hoped to die on the operating table.\n\nBut in the weeks after surgery, Donovan said, he started to feel better. Although he takes antidepressants, Donovan said, he is sure drugs are not responsible, because they hadn't helped him previously.\n\nDonovan, who is featured on the Cyberonics Web site, said he has no financial relationship with the company. He recently self-published a book about his experiences, entitled \"Out of the Black Hole,\" and runs a pro-VNS Web site for patients. \"I am so humbled by this treatment and grateful,\" he said.\n\nOthers have had far less positive experiences. Among them is Katherine V. Coram, 58, of Silver Spring who got the implant in the same study as Donovan. Coram said she knew she was in the group with the activated device because she could feel it going off, she said. She frequently lost her voice while she was talking and felt a persistent constriction in the back of her throat. Both are common side effects of VNS treatment.\n\nCoram said the device seemed to help a bit at first, but when the doctor turned up the settings, she felt suicidal for the first time in years. Worsening depression and suicide attempts were reported by one-third of patients in one study funded by Cyberonics, according to data presented to the FDA.\n\nLast year Coram said she had the generator removed from her chest because it wasn't helping. The electrodes in her neck must remain forever; doctors tell VNS patients that removing them is too risky because tissue grows around them As a result, VNS recipients cannot undergo a full body MRI or therapeutic ultrasound.\n\n\"I'm still angry about the whole thing,\" said Coram, who said she regrets getting the implant and currently relies on the standby treatments: psychotherapy and antidepressants.\n\n\"You get desperate when you've been depressed for years,\" she said. \"This sounds benign, like a pacemaker.

Another 7,000 people -- aided by a network of nurses hired by Cyberonics, the Houston-based manufacturer of the device -- are seeking approval from their insurance companies for the $25,000 operation.", "More than 3,700 psychiatrists, including doctors affiliated with Suburban, Georgetown, Sheppard Pratt and Howard University hospitals, have been trained in the use of VNS, the first device ever approved to treat depression. It consists of a battery-operated generator attached to an electrode implanted in the vagus nerve in the neck. The generator emits regular pulses of electricity that are supposed to stimulate serotonin and other brain chemicals believed to regulate mood, according to Cyberonics.", "Yet despite the imprimatur of the FDA and an aggressive marketing campaign mounted by the company, the most basic question about the treatment remains unanswered: Does it work? Is VNS a lifesaving treatment for chronic depression, as some patients and doctors maintain, or an unproven and potentially harmful treatment based on flimsy science, as critics contend?", "At the heart of the debate is this: The only rigorous clinical trial of the device -- which is approved to treat severe epilepsy -- failed to demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating depression. That study involved 235 patients, all of whom received the device, which was turned on in only half the group. At the end of three months, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.", "A second study of 174 VNS recipients found that 30 percent showed significant improvement after one year. Because that study lacked a control group and because patients received other depression treatments after the device was implanted, there is no way to know whether the device was responsible.

But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping for a little improvement,\u201d remembered the 72-year-old retired New Jersey corrections officer, who had battled the disease for a decade. He and his oncologist both broke down when she delivered the good news in 2010. \u201cNobody was hoping for zero cancer.\u201d\n\nThe pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Six-year-old Emily Whitehead, who was near death, became the first pediatric recipient in 2012. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free.\n\nSuch results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An FDA advisory committee will decide Wednesday whether to recommend approval of the approach, which uses patients\u2019 own genetically altered immune cells to fight blood cancers.\n\nIf the panel gives the nod, the agency probably will follow suit by the end of September. That would open the latest chapter in immunotherapy \u2014 \u201ca true living drug,\u201d said Penn scientist Carl June, who led its development.\n\nThe CAR T-cell treatment, manufactured by the drug company Novartis, initially would be available only for the small number of children and young adults whose leukemia does not respond to standard care. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so.\n\nAnd childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. Kite Pharma of Santa Monica, Calif., has applied for FDA approval to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and a similar Novartis application is close behind. Researchers also are exploring CAR T-cell therapy\u2019s use for multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the disease that afflicted Ludwig. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge \u2014 using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example.\n\nThe excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. \u201cWe\u2019re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit\u2019s end trying to keep alive,\u201d said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease \u2014 those who have exhausted all options \u2014 into remission.\n\nYet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure.\n\nIt involves extracting white blood cells called T cells \u2014 the foot soldiers of the immune system \u2014 from a patient\u2019s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis\u2019s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. There, a crippled HIV fragment is used to genetically modify the T cells so they can find and attack the cancer. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient.\n\nOnce inside the person\u2019s body, the T-cell army multiplies astronomically.\n\nNovartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion. Brad Loncar, whose investment fund focuses on companies that develop immunotherapy treatments, hopes the cost does not prompt a backlash. \u201cCAR-T is not the EpiPen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is truly pushing the envelope and at the cutting edge of science.\u201d\n\nThe biggest concerns, however, center on safety. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use.\n\n\u201cTreating patients safely is the heart of the rollout,\u201d said Stephan Grupp of Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, who as director of the hospital\u2019s cancer immunotherapy program led early pediatric studies as well as Novartis\u2019s global trial. \u201cThe efficacy takes care of itself, but safety takes a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nOne of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. The other major worry is neurotoxicity, which can result in temporary confusion or potentially fatal brain swelling. Juno Therapeutics, a biotech firm in Seattle, shut down one of its CAR T-cell programs after five patients died of brain swelling. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said.\n\nTo try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others.\n\nGrupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy \u2014 and what to do about them \u2014 through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead.\n\nThe young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Surely, this has been tried on kids somewhere else in the world,\u2019 \u201d recalled her father, Thomas Whitehead of Philipsburg, Pa. \u201cBut Steve said, \u2018Nope, some adults got it, but that was a different kind of leukemia.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter she received the therapy, Emily\u2019s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. Doctors decided to give Emily an immunosuppressant drug called tocilizumab.\n\nShe was dramatically better within hours. She woke up the next day, her seventh birthday. Tests showed her cancer was gone.\n\nThe approval of CAR T-cell therapy would represent the second big immunotherapy advance in less than a decade. In 2011, the FDA cleared the first agent in a new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. It has approved five more since then.\n\nThere are big differences between the two approaches. The checkpoint inhibitors are targeted at solid tumors, such as advanced melanoma and lung and bladder cancer, while CAR T-cell therapy has been aimed at blood disorders. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. Many immunotherapy experts think the greatest progress against cancer will be achieved when researchers figure out how to combine the approaches.\n\nFor the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful.\n\nThe pair moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and dove into cancer research. Two years later, June\u2019s wife died of ovarian cancer, something he has credited as spurring him to work even harder in the field. In the years that followed, researchers across the country, including at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, racked up an array of tantalizing discoveries involving T cells.\n\nFast-forward to 2010, when Ludwig, who lives in Bridgeton, N.J., became Penn\u2019s first patient to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died.\n\nBut after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. To try to raise interest and funding, they decided to publish the results of their work. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a \u201cfirestorm,\u201d June said \u2014 one that brought them new resources. David Porter, a Penn oncologist working with June, was on vacation in western Maryland and had to stop at a Kohl\u2019s to buy a dress shirt for the immediate TV interviews.\n\nThe pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily. Six months later, Penn licensed its technology to Novartis in exchange for financial support, which included a new on-campus cell-manufacturing facility.\n\nWith FDA approval seeming imminent, the researchers who were so instrumental in the therapy\u2019s development and testing are almost giddy. Grupp is especially pleased that the advance will be available first to children. \u201cUsually everything is developed first for adults,\u201d he noted recently, \u201cand children are an afterthought.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is not the end\u2019: Using immunotherapy and a genetic glitch to give cancer patients hope\n\nThis 8-year-old is free of cancer \u2014 for now \u2014 after a \u2018breakthrough\u2019 treatment\n\nFor a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine\u2019s hottest field", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "The story tackles this issue head on, as here: \u201cNovartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion.\u201d", "answer": 1, "paragraphs": ["When doctors saw the report on Bill Ludwig\u2019s bone-marrow biopsy, they thought it was a mistake and ordered the test repeated.

Americans suffering from heart disease, meditation might help prevent heart attacks, strokes and early death, a small new study suggests.\n\nThese benefits appear to be the results of meditation's ability to lower blood pressure, stress and anger, all of which have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, researchers say.\n\n\"This is a whole new physiological effect on top of conventional treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Robert Schneider, director of the Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention in Fairfield, Iowa. \"People can prevent heart disease reoccurrence using their own mind-body connection. People have this internal self-healing ability.\"\n\nAn outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease.\n\nThe new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. Originally from India, it is not associated with any particular religion or philosophy. It is thought to produce alpha brain waves that occur in deep relaxation. According to the Maharishi Foundation, more than 5 million people worldwide practice this type of meditation.\n\nThe research focused on blacks because they are at a higher risk than whites of having heart attacks and strokes and dying from heart disease, Schneider said. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations.\n\n\"Other studies have been done among whites and the results are similar,\" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the Nov. 13 issue of the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. The study was sponsored by the Maharishi University of Management and funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\nFor the study, Schneider's team randomly assigned 201 black Americans with heart disease either to a Transcendental Meditation stress-reducing program or health education class about lifestyle modification in diet and exercise.\n\nAlmost 60 percent of the participants were taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Forty-one percent of the meditation group took aspirin, as did 31 percent of the health education group; 38 percent of the meditation group and 43 percent of the health education group smoked, the researchers noted.\n\nParticipants' average body-mass index -- a measurement of body fat based on height and weight -- was 32, which is considered obese.\n\nMeditation consisted of sitting with eyes closed for about 20 minutes twice a day. The goal was to rest while remaining alert.\n\nAfter more than five years of follow-up, the researchers found those who meditated saw significant reductions in blood pressure and anger compared to those receiving health education. In addition, 20 people in the medication group had a heart attack or stroke or died, compared with 32 in the health education group.\n\nBoth groups increased exercise and drank less. For those who meditated, there was a trend toward reduced smoking; however, this was not statistically significant.\n\nLearning how to do Transcendental Meditation isn't inexpensive. An initial 10-hour course runs about $1,500 when taught by nonprofit groups, and there is continued lifetime follow-up, Schneider said.\n\nAnd it's not something you can learn by yourself. \"You've got to have a teacher right there in front of you teaching according to experience,\" he said. \"So it's only learned live.\"\n\nTranscendental Meditation is not generally covered by health insurance, he said. \"One of the reasons we did the study is because insurance and Medicare calls for citing evidence for what's to be reimbursed,\" Schneider said. \"This study will lead toward reimbursement. That's the whole idea.\"\n\nBut a cardiology expert said that although the study adds to evidence supporting meditation, it doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the practice and better health outcomes.\n\n\"Transcendental Meditation has been reported to have health benefits and has been evaluated in a number of studies,\" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nSome studies have suggested favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factors whereas others studies have been inconclusive, he said.\n\nEven though the findings in this study were statistically significant, the new study was too small to be conclusive, Fonarow said.\n\n\"In addition, since this study was conducted at a single center and the primary [change in heart attack, stroke and death] was not statistically significant without adjustment for other factors, more studies and replication of these findings are needed,\" he said.\n\nFor more information on heart disease, visit the American Heart Association.", "question": "Does the story adequately discuss the costs of the intervention?", "explanation": "According to the story, \u201cAn initial 10-hour course runs about $1,500 when taught by nonprofit groups, and there is continued lifetime follow-up.\u201d And it\u2019s generally not covered by insurance.", "answer": 1, "paragraphs": ["TUESDAY, Nov. 13, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- For black Americans suffering from heart disease, meditation might help prevent heart attacks, strokes and early death, a small new study suggests.", "These benefits appear to be the results of meditation's ability to lower blood pressure, stress and anger, all of which have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, researchers say.", "\"This is a whole new physiological effect on top of conventional treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Robert Schneider, director of the Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention in Fairfield, Iowa. \"People can prevent heart disease reoccurrence using their own mind-body connection.

Massachusetts General Hospital. Orthopedic surgeon George Theodore is about to blast her foot with powerful shock waves generated by sound.\n\nAfter numbing her foot with Novocain, Theodore turns on an expensive German-made machine that beams tightly focused sound energy at Cassidy Driscoll's heel, near the point where her painful plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. Suddenly the room is filled with the rhythmic click-click-click of a metronome.\n\nIt's a kind of paradox: Theodore is damaging her foot in order to heal it.\n\n\"The shocks are like a little baseball bat hitting the tissue,\" Theodore says. \"It's producing a little bit of a repair process -- a little microbleeding.\"\n\nThe healing process takes place over several months after the shock-wave therapy, which Theodore does in a single treatment. [Other centers use lower-energy shock waves over several treatments.]\n\nTheodore has been doing the shock-wave therapy for plantar fasciitis for about eight years, after longer experiences in Europe. It's the same technology used since the 1980s to blast kidney stones, an application called lithotripsy, but for foot problems doctors use less intense shock waves.\n\nShock-wave therapy for plantar fasciitis is beginning to catch on around the U.S., partly since this stubborn type of foot pain is so common -- and so difficult to treat. Nearly 2 million Americans seek care for plantar fasciitis (pronounced PLAN-tar FASH-ee-EYE-tus) every year.\n\nTheodore tells Cassidy Driscoll that shock-wave therapy gives her a 60 to 80 percent chance of reducing her pain by half; about one-quarter of patients will become pain-free from the treatment.\n\nAfter the 20-minute treatment, Cassidy Driscoll says she felt no pain, only a sort of tapping. She gets off the table, walks out of Theodore's office and drives herself home. Two days later, she says her foot felt bruised, but she didn't have enough pain to require medication.\n\nCassidy Driscoll will pay $1,000 for the treatment. Elsewhere the charge can range from $500 to several thousand dollars. But most insurers won't pay for it, because they consider it experimental.\n\nStudies have given conflicting results, partly because there's no standardized way of doing shock-wave therapy. Different doctors use different sources of energy, different doses and a differing number of treatments.\n\n\"Is it rock-solid science that everyone agrees on? I would say no,\" says Dr. Naven Duggal, another Harvard orthopedic surgeon at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\nDuggal is not impressed with reported success rates.\n\n\"Sixty to 80 percent [success] for something that somebody's not going to get guaranteed pain relief -- in my mind, it's not something I would go for,\" Duggal says.\n\nDuggal says foot specialists don't really know what causes the pain of plantar fasciitis.\n\nThe plantar fascia is a tough, rubber-band-like structure on the bottom of the foot.\n\nIt has to be strong, because every time the foot strikes the ground, the plantar fascia bears the body's full weight. In high-impact activities like running, the forces even exceed the actual weight because it's so concentrated in a narrow spot where the fascia attaches to the heel bone. That's presumably why sufferers of plantar fasciitis feel the pain in the heel.\n\nConcepts of what plantar fasciitis is have changed in recent years. Doctors used to think it occurred because the fascia became inflamed \u2013- in fact, the suffix \"-itis\" denotes inflammation. But while inflammation can be involved in plantar fasciitis, it doesn't seem to be the cause, Duggal says.\n\nMany think that plantar fasciitis is caused by heel spurs, bony hook-like growths that develop on many people's heels due to stress. But specialists don't think that anymore.\n\nAs ideas of what plantar fasciitis is change, so have treatments. Doctors don't do surgery for it anymore except in rare cases, largely because they've found surgery often makes people worse off.\n\n\"Patients have to be patient,\" Duggal says. \"They have to understand that this condition unfortunately is not fully understood.\"\n\nHe's interested in another experimental treatment that's just entering clinical trials. It's called platelet-rich plasma, and it involves isolating blood cells called platelets from patients' own blood and injecting them into the plantar fascia. Though platelets are best known for their role in initiating blood clots, they also contain growth factors. So the hope is that platelet injections will stimulate healing without the damaging effects of shock-wave therapy. But it will be some years before that approach is proven -- or not.\n\nMeanwhile, foot specialists and their patients are left with a smattering of low-tech treatments that they say all plantar fasciitis patients should try, whether or not they eventually go on to shock-wave therapy.\n\n-- Icing the bottom of the foot, sometimes using ice to massage the heel area\n\n-- Using cups made of gel in shoes to cushion the heel (and many orthopedic surgeons say expensive custom-made orthotics are not necessary)\n\n-- Wearing a night splint, a simple brace that holds the foot in a flexed position to keep the plantar fascia stretched during sleep\n\n-- Physical therapy, though some studies indicate that some PT practices such as ultrasound and whirlpool are not helpful\n\n-- Use of NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen\n\n-- Corticosteroid injections into the heel, though this is controversial and should not be used repeatedly\n\n-- Backing off activities like running until the pain goes away, and then reinitiating them gradually\n\nAbout 90 percent of sufferers will get better with time. Duggal says he advises patients to try a combination of these measures for at least a year.\n\nKaren Firestone, a 54-year-old Boston businesswoman and avid runner, says that techniques like stretching, icing and taping were effective for her. She started having plantar fascia pain last summer, and on Duggal's advice has been diligent about doing everything she can to heal the problem.\n\n\"The stretching, the icing, the taping -- I do all these little pieces of help for my body, and it responds,\" Firestone says. \"So I think people should take that message and go with it.\"\n\nAfter a few months, she's back to running -- but shorter distances.

Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room.\n\nOn one particularly bad night, Ms. DiGiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe. Gasping for air, she was certain she would not survive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that feeling,\u201d said Ms. DiGiusto, 65, a speech pathologist in Braintree, Mass. \u201cThe feeling that I\u2019m never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Ms. DiGiusto\u2019s doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty, the first non-drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe asthma.\n\nDuring the procedure, a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient\u2019s airways. There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.\n\nMs. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. \u201cI\u2019m a language therapist,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.\n\nAvoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone \u2014 which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects \u2014 become a necessity.\n\nNationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.\n\nDoctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.\n\n\u201cFor those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it\u2019s frustrating because we have this new therapy, we\u2019ve seen it work, and the data says it works,\u201d said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. \u201cBut the big insurers have all denied it.\u201d\n\nAlthough bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.\n\nIt takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.\n\nBut several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough,\u201d said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life.\u201d For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who \u2014 unlike a vast majority of asthma patients \u2014 cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are millions and millions of asthmatics,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will not be millions of thermoplasty patients.\u201d\n\nStill, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.\n\nUntil then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. \u201cThe issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established,\u201d she said.\n\nBut three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach.

The study also noted that the device provides a helpful guide for post-treatment mammograms and other long-term follow-up to check for any cancer recurrence in these patients.\n\nA second study, presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2016 annual conference, describes the extra utility that BioZorb can provide, by significantly reducing the amount of normal breast and surrounding tissues that are exposed to radiation treatment.\n\nThe World Journal of Surgery article, by lead author breast surgeon Michael J. Cross, concluded that the 3-D marker is an \"effective method for delineating the tumor bed with a significant utility for RT (radiation therapy) planning.\"\n\nIn the course of this three-year study, Dr. Cross and colleagues also documented a favorable shift toward use of hypo-fractionated radiation treatment, a shorter form of radiation associated with a substantial reduction in treatment costs.\n\n\"Through our experience with this marker, we've observed that its use results in less radiation dose to the patient compared to whole breast radiation, plus a better overall cosmetic outcome,\" said Dr. Cross, a nationally known breast surgeon at Breast Treatment Associates, in Fayetteville Ark. \"We were also pleased to note in our research that there were no device-related complications in this group of patients, and that none of them had a recurrence of cancer.\"\n\nThe BioZorb device is placed during lumpectomy surgery, which removes the cancer and preserves the breast. It is the first and only device that identifies in a reliable way the 3-D region where the tumor was removed. It is particularly effective because by suturing the implant to the tumor bed, the surgeon can more precisely indicate to the radiation oncologist where the cancer was located. Dr. Cross notes that because of the marker's unique configuration, it can also assist with reconstructing the surgical region during the healing process.\n\nThe implantable marker consists of a framework made of a bioabsorbable material that holds six titanium clips. The framework slowly dissolves in the body over the course of a year or more. The tiny marker clips stay in place so the surgical site can be viewed for long-term monitoring such as mammograms.\n\nAs part of the research for the World Journal of Surgery study, 108 patients with early-stage breast cancer were prospectively implanted with the marker during \"reconstructive lumpectomy,\" a method of oncoplastic surgery to remove the cancer while reconstructing the remaining breast to improve cosmetic outcomes. The average age of women in the study was 63 years.\n\nThe authors concluded that the marker was helpful for several different types of physicians involved in the care of women with breast cancer: surgeons, radiation oncologists who plan and oversee radiation treatment, and radiologists who follow women after breast cancer treatment.\n\nThe article also noted that there was a shift during the three-year course of the study toward increasing use of hypo-fractionated radiation methods. These methods decrease the time it takes for patients to complete radiation treatment -- and are estimated to cut the cost of treatment by approximately 25%. The authors said use of the marker facilitated their shift toward these shorter courses of radiotherapy.\n\nUse of the marker allowed physicians to be more confident in their targeting and rely less on \"ambiguous planning targets such as the seroma and surrounding tissue changes.\" Seroma is a collection of fluid that builds up in the area of tissue injury after surgery.\n\nWhile seromas have customarily been targeted for radiation treatment, they do not always reflect where the cancer was and can overestimate the size of the target areas in need of radiation. By more precisely marking the tumor bed, the article said, BioZorb can reduce the amount of healthy tissue that would otherwise receive unnecessary radiation.\n\nThe second recent study, presented at the 2016 annual ASTRO conference in Boston, described a collaborative approach between a radiation oncologist and breast surgeon. They studied the question of whether the marker could better identify the true lumpectomy cavity and thereby reduce the amount of tissue that is irradiated.\n\nThe authors \u2013 radiation oncologist William Hall, M.D., and breast surgeon Cary Kaufman, M.D. -- combined their analysis of 10 cases in which BioZorb was used.\n\nThey concluded that the tissue marker could significantly reduce radiation of healthy breast tissue (an average of 65% reduction), as well as avoid irradiating inadvertent seromas that are more common with oncoplastic procedures. By providing better targeting, they said, the marker could also play a role in facilitating the use of external beam partial breast irradiation.\n\n\"The process of delivering radiation treatment is substantially streamlined by having the 3D marker in place,\" said Dr. Hall. \"The marker tells us where the tumor was and helps us determine appropriate forms of treatment, whether with partial breast irradiation or standard whole breast irradiation and a boost dose at the end of the treatment process.\"\n\nDr. Hall is a radiation oncologist in the Department of Radiation Oncology at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center (Bellingham, Wash). Dr. Kaufman is Medical Director of the Bellingham Regional Breast Center and past chairman of the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers.\n\nFocal Therapeutics is a medical device company based in Aliso Viejo, Calif. The company's BioZorb marker is a proprietary bioabsorbable device that provides radiographic marking of soft tissue sites.

Gains after two years were about the same for Eylea and Lucentis (ranibizumab), contrary to year-one results from the study, which showed Eylea with a clear advantage. The three drugs yielded similar gains in vision for patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment. The clinical trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), which is funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThis rigorous trial confirms that Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all effective treatments for diabetic macular edema,\u201d said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. \u201cEye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs.\u201d\n\nEylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all widely used to treat DME, a consequence of diabetes that can cause blurring of central vision due to the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the retina. The macula is the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The drugs are injected into the eye and work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance that can promote abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. Although the drugs have a similar mode of action, they differ significantly in cost. Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about $1850 for Eylea, about $60 for Avastin, and about $1200 for Lucentis.\n\nDRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. When the study began, participants on average were 61 years old with 17 years of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Only people with a visual acuity of 20/32 or worse were eligible to participate (to see clearly, a person with 20/32 vision would have to be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal vision could see clearly at 32 feet). At enrollment, about half the participants had 20/32 to 20/40 vision. The other half had 20/50 or worse vision. In many states, a corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye is required for a driver\u2019s license that allows both day- and nighttime driving.\n\nEach participant was assigned randomly to receive Eylea (2.0 milligrams/0.05 milliliter), Avastin (1.25 mg/0.05 mL), or Lucentis (0.3 mg/0.05 mL). Participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 4-16 weeks during the second year. Most participants received monthly injections during the first six months. Thereafter, participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until DME resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement. Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago.\n\nAmong participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial\u2019s start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants\u2019 vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25.\n\nAmong participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial\u2019s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups.\n\n\u201cThe results of the DRCR Network\u2019s comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,\u201d said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cThe study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient\u2019s loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin.\u201d\n\nThe number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year.\n\nThe need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups. By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group.\n\nThe risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies. Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes. The occurrence of eye complications, such as eye infections and inflammation, was similar for all three drugs.\n\nResults of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Eylea and Lucentis were provided by drug manufacturers Regeneron and Genentech, respectively. Additional research funding for this study was provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, also a part of NIH.\n\n\u201cThis important study would not have happened without funding from the National Institutes of Health and the cooperation of two competing companies,\u201d said Adam R.

Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago.", "Among participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial\u2019s start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants\u2019 vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25.", "Among participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial\u2019s start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups.", "\u201cThe results of the DRCR Network\u2019s comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,\u201d said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cThe study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient\u2019s loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin.\u201d", "The number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups.

Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies.

Nearly half the pregnancies among American women are unintended \u2014 unwanted now or within the next two years. And among sexually active teenagers and young adults, the rate of unplanned pregnancy is even higher.\n\nFully 43 percent of these pregnancies follow incorrect or inconsistent uses of contraception. Of course, some couples fail to use any contraception, but others rely on contraceptive methods that have significant failure rates even when properly used.\n\nThese facts prompted a committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists this month to urge its members to introduce women of all ages to the most effective and underused methods of reversible contraception: IUDs and hormonal implants. Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization.\n\nIn a 2012 study of 7,486 women aged 14 to 45, long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, were shown to be 20 times as effective in preventing pregnancy than the pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women.\n\nYet fewer than 10 percent of sexually active women currently rely on long-acting reversible contraception, and a major reason is doctors\u2019 reluctance to recommend them. Only about half of obstetrician-gynecologists offer the implant, the committee said, and many physicians use \u201coverly restrictive criteria\u201d when deciding whether to recommend an IUD, especially for adolescents and women who have not yet been pregnant.\n\nGreater LARC use can reduce birthrates among adolescents and, for women of all ages, a reliance upon abortion to prevent unwanted births, the experts wrote in the October issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nFurthermore, the higher upfront costs of LARC methods are no longer an impediment for women with insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act. Megan L. Kavanaugh, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, said in an interview that \u201call new insurance plans obtained through the act\u2019s exchanges fully cover all contraceptive methods without any co-payments or other out-of-pocket costs.\u201d Title X family planning clinics and Planned Parenthood clinics are more likely than other sources to offer LARC methods, she said.\n\nIn a paper published two years ago, European experts predicted that \u201cafter decades of dominance by \u2018the Pill,\u2019 it is likely that in the future, long-acting reversible contraceptives will become the first-line contraceptive option, owing to their superior contraceptive effectiveness in real-life use, cost effectiveness as well as their established safety profile.\u201d\n\nHere is a summary of the advantages of LARCs, listed by the committee:\n\n\u25a0 They are independent of the sex act and do not depend on the user\u2019s motivation and reliability.\n\n\u25a0 Compared with other reversible methods, they are more effective and have higher rates of continued use and user satisfaction.\n\n\u25a0 There is no need to get frequent supplies and no additional costs once they are inserted, making them highly cost effective.\n\n\u25a0 There are few contraindications for their use, and fertility returns quickly after removal.\n\nFurthermore, the committee stated, \u201calmost all women are appropriate candidates\u201d for the LARC methods currently available. They are an implant that slowly releases the hormone etonogestrel over a period of three years, and four IUDs: the copper T that can be used for up to 10 years, and three IUDs containing the hormone levonorgestrel (two approved for use up to three years, and one approved for up to five years).\n\nIn real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. In contrast, women using the pill, patch or vaginal ring face an annual pregnancy risk of 9 percent; the diaphragm is associated with a 12 percent pregnancy rate, and with condoms, cervical caps and sponges, the rate is 18 percent.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no one best contraceptive method for every woman or every couple, women should have access to all methods and should know how effective the LARCs are,\u201d Dr. Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe etonogestrel implant is a small plastic rod resembling a matchstick that is inserted under the skin in the upper arm. The hormone, a form of progesterone, prevents ovulation and thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Though the implant can remain in place and effective for three years, it can also be removed sooner if, for example, a woman decides she wants to become pregnant. Typically with the implant, menstrual bleeding diminishes, and after a year, one woman in three stops having periods. However, some women develop longer, heavier periods, and some have increased spotting between periods.\n\nLikewise with the hormonal IUDs. Levonorgestrel, also a progesterone, changes the cervical mucus, blocking the transport of sperm and fertilization of an egg. It also suppresses growth of the uterine lining and thus reduces cramping and heavy menstrual bleeding. Women using it report a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss.\n\nThe copper IUD does not contain hormones. Rather, the copper is toxic to sperm, preventing them from fertilizing an egg. Because it also prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, the copper IUD can serve as emergency contraception for up to five days following unprotected intercourse.\n\nBoth the implant and IUD can be used by women who are breast-feeding, as well as those who cannot take estrogen.

Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now.\n\n\"The question is, what's the magnitude of difference that would change the patient's mind?\" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nOne man may view a 15 percent chance that his tumor is aggressive as low risk \"but someone else might say, 'Oh my God, let's set the surgery up tomorrow,'\" he said. \"I don't think it's a slam dunk.\"\n\nAlso unknown: Will insurers pay for the expensive test without evidence it leads to better care or saves lives?\n\nThe newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004.

Another test for assessing prostate cancer risk that came out last summer \u2014 Prolaris by Myriad Genetics Inc. \u2014 sells for $3,400.\n\nBoth companies can sell the tests without Food and Drug Administration approval under separate rules that govern lab diagnostics. Myriad Genetics has published nine studies on Prolaris involving more than 3,000 patients. Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary. Yet it has a track record from its breast cancer test.\n\nAbout 240,000 men in the U.S. are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and about half are classified as low risk using current methods. Doctors now base risk estimates on factors such as a man's age and how aggressive cells look from biopsies that give 12 to 14 tissue samples. But tumors often are spread out and vary from one spot to the other.\n\n\"Unless you can be sure your biopsy has hit the most aggressive part that's in the prostate, you can't be sure\" how accurate your risk estimate is, explained Dr. Eric Klein, chief of urology at the Cleveland Clinic, who led early development of the Oncotype prostate cancer test.\n\nFor one study, researchers used prostates removed from 440 men. They measured the activity of hundreds of genes thought to be involved in whether the cancer spread beyond the prostate or proved fatal. A second study of biopsies from 167 patients narrowed it down to 81 genes, and researchers picked 17 that seemed to predict aggressiveness no matter the location in the tumor.\n\nA third study used single needle-biopsy samples from 395 UCSF patients scheduled to have their prostates removed. The gene test accurately predicted the aggressiveness of their cancer once doctors were able to see the whole prostate after surgery.\n\nUsing one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.\n\n\"It went both ways \u2014 that was the remarkable thing. In any category of risk it added independent information compared to the standard criteria we use today,\" Carroll said. \"More work needs to be done, but, in my opinion, this is a very good start.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.\n\n\"It's not there yet,\" he said.\n\nUCSF just got a federal grant to see how men choose treatments and whether this test might sway them.\n\n\"We throw all these numbers at them. Are they really going to make a better decision?\" Cooperberg said.\n\nDean Smith, 60, a retired marketing executive from Mill Valley, Calif., is following his doctor's advice to monitor the cancer he was diagnosed with in March. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.\n\nAt least six of his friends suffered side effects ranging from urinary leakage to inability to have sex after having their prostates removed.\n\n\"I would suspect that having cancer and having to live with it would be very difficult for them,\" but it doesn't bother him, Smith said. \"I will die from something other than prostate cancer, I guarantee you.\"\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

"MONDAY, July 6, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A scan of calcium deposits inside your arteries can help doctors deduce how long you're likely to live, a new study has found.\n\nThe test, called a coronary calcium scan, uses a regular CT scan to look for calcium deposits in the three major arteries that carry blood away from the heart, said lead author Leslee Shaw, a professor of cardiology at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nPeople with the largest amounts of calcium in their arteries carry an early death risk that's six times greater than those with no calcium deposits, researchers found in a 15-year study of nearly 10,000 patients.\n\n\"If you had no calcium or very small amounts, we were able to track over a very long time that you actually had a very outstanding survival,\" Shaw said.\n\nCalcium deposits develop as a response to plaque formation along the artery walls, Shaw said.\n\nThese plaques, which are caused by blood cholesterol, build up over time and cause arteries to narrow, leading to heart disease as the heart works harder to pump blood through the body.\n\nIf a plaque bursts, a blood clot can form on its surface, blocking blood flow and causing a heart attack, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. If the clot breaks free, it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke.\n\nTo prevent plaques from bursting, the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them, Shaw said.\n\nDoctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said.\n\nUp to now, however, there's been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a person's long-term health risk, the study authors said in background information. Most studies involving these scans have a follow-up of five years or less.\n\nIn this new study, doctors referred 9,715 healthy patients in the Nashville area between 1996 and 1999 to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the military's Tricare Healthcare System. The patients underwent a calcium scan, and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors.\n\nResearchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years, taking special note of the 936 patients who died.\n\nAnalysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a person's major arteries.\n\nPatients with small levels of arterial calcium had a 68 percent increased overall risk of death, compared to those with no calcium deposits at all. But people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium.\n\n\"This is not a new test, but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors,\" said Dr. William Zoghbi, past president of the American College of Cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nCalcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems, Zoghbi said. This study confirms their usefulness in that regard, he said.\n\n\"Calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms,\" he said. \"The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known.\"\n\nThe results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits, and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves, Shaw said.\n\n\"It can be a very potent motivator,\" she said.\n\nPeople with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said.\n\nShaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a person's regular physical exam, as common as blood cholesterol tests.

Caruso, the chief commercial officer for Allos, a 17-year-old publicly traded company based in Westminster, Colo., that has no other drugs on the market.\n\nMr. Caruso also said the price of Folotyn was not out of line with that of other drugs for rare cancers. Patients, moreover, are likely to use the drug for only a couple of months because the tumor worsens so quickly, he said. So the total cost of using Folotyn will be less than for many other drugs with lower monthly prices.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are fairly priced,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re benchmarked\u201d against other drugs. In a conference call with analysts last month, Mr. Caruso said Allos had \u201cnot had pushback of any type at this point\u201d from insurers.\n\nSome drugs for rare cancers are close to Foltyn\u2019s price. Genzyme\u2019s Clolar for pediatric leukemia costs about $34,000 a week, though the company says that only two weeks of treatment are typically needed.

About $60,000 of the cost would be incurred in the first eight weeks, when the drug is given more frequently.\n\nGloucester Pharmaceuticals, which won approval in November for a drug to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, another rare cancer, declined to discuss what it would charge when that treatment, called Istodax, goes on sale in January.\n\nDespite such comparisons, Dr. Lee N. Newcomer, senior vice president for oncology at the big insurer UnitedHealthcare, called the price of Folotyn \u201cunconscionable.\u201d He said that Folotyn alone would cost as much as UnitedHealthcare now typically spends in total to treat a lymphoma patient from diagnosis until death. That median expenditure now, he said, is $87,000 for a little over a year of treatments.\n\nBut Dr. Newcomer said insurers would be obligated to pay for Folotyn because there were no alternatives.\n\nFolotyn has not yet shown an effect on longevity. In the clinical trial that led to approval of the drug, 27 percent of the 109 patients experienced a reduction in tumor size. The reductions lasted a median of 9.4 months.\n\nBut considering all the patients in the trial, only 12 percent had a reduction in tumor size that lasted for more than 14 weeks.

In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.\n\nBut what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer?\n\nThe Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.\n\nOther medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.\n\nBut few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. A 2010 study found \u201cexceptionally low\u201d rates of usage.\n\nIn part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women\u2019s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.\n\nThe \u201clow uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,\u201d says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. \u201cMany high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.\u201d On the other hand, these drugs don\u2019t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious \u2014 such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer \u2014 only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that \u201chigh risk\u201d definition\n\nChemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.\n\nAnd they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.\n\nA 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.\n\nInvestigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.\n\nNelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is \u201cconfident\u201d that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.\n\nKenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force\u2019s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they \u201chave not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.\u201d One possible explanation, he says, is that \u201cthese drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.\u201d\n\nNot used enough?\n\nGiven that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.\n\nFor some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman\u2019s chances of having breast cancer in a five-year period and over a lifetime.\n\nBut this is where it gets more complicated. While many experts agree that women at high risk should consider the medications, they do not agree on what Gail score should trigger that consideration.\n\nThe studies that served as the basis for the FDA approval of the drugs, along with recently released guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), set the threshold at a five-year Gail score of 1.67 percent.\n\nThe Preventive Services Task Force, however, recommended a threshold of 3 percent. At that point, the panel said, women \u201care likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene.\u201d\n\nASCO\u2019s lower cutoff worries some experts. \u201cAt the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,\u201d Georgetown\u2019s Lin says, \u201cevery woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.\u201d That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects.\n\nKala Visvanathan, the lead author of the ASCO recommendations and a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the cutoffs provide only a rough estimate of risk.\n\nIt is important to realize, she adds, that \u201cas the risk increases, the benefits tend to be greater. This is an evolving field, and our goal is to better discern who is at high and low risk of breast cancer and develop a greater range of prevention strategies.\u201d\n\nAn individual risk analysis should prompt conversation between doctor and patient about the potential benefits and the risk of the therapy.\n\nBoth the ASCO and the task force guidelines recommend such a conversation. \u201cThe discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent,\u201d according to ASCO.\n\nThe task force similarly recommends that \u201cclinicians engage in a shared, informed decision making\u201d with women and said that clinicians \u201cshould offer to prescribe\u201d these drugs. Many risk factors increase a woman\u2019s chances of having side effects. These factors include older age, obesity, having a history of a blood clot, history of any cancer, immobility, history of certain autoimmune conditions, history of using estrogen or oral contraceptives and history of some form of heart disease.\n\nInsured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.\n\nSo what should a woman do?\n\nMost important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes \u2014 including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not overconsuming alcohol \u2014 are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.\n\nVisvanathan and her colleagues are hopeful that more women will be aware of this option.\n\n\u201cA discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should begin to implement preventive strategies based on what we already know.\u201d\n\nMishori is an associate professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the Health & Media fellowship.

Most of these are what are called mild traumatic brain injuries, or mTBIs \u2014 head injuries that don't cause a coma. People with an mTBI typically get better within a few weeks, but for as many as 20 percent, problems can linger for months or years.\n\nMany of these patients find themselves stuck with depression, cognitive problems, headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. Known as post-concussion syndrome, this phenomenon is often difficult to treat. Antidepressants can lift moods, painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness, but most researchers agree that these remedies don't heal the injury within the brain.\n\nCould oxygen do the trick? A growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment, which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher-than-normal air pressure, may work.\n\n\"These patients don't have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains,\" said Shai Efrati, a researcher and physician at Tel Aviv University in Israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist. \"Hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain.\"\n\nBut other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended.\n\n\"People want to believe that hyperbaric can fix [brain injuries], and it can't,\" said David Cifu, a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries.\n\nCompressed air has been used by doctors since the 17th century. In 1917, two German inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness, which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly. For the past 50 years, hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for non-healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns and decompression sickness. Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs.\n\nMTBIs include sports-related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents. Also, between 2000 and 2017, 308,853 American service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, according to the Department of Defense.\n\nPatients with an mTBI typically experience symptoms that include headache, dizziness, fatigue, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), this phenomenon is difficult to treat. Doctors use antidepressants, pain medications, biofeedback and physical therapy, but these strategies do not always work.\n\nThe nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. And often, the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. So, just as the brain needs extra resources, it faces an energy crisis. Often, Efrati and others say, injured brain cells don't die, but may persist for years or decades, alive but hobbled. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury.\n\n\"Oxygen is different, because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue,\" said Paul G. Harch, a physician in New Orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke.\n\nPatients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months. During each treatment, they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber, which varies in size from a person-size tube to a large room that can hold several patients. While in the chamber, patients breathe in pure oxygen, typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea-level air; in this environment, the lungs take in about 10 times as much oxygen as under normal conditions.\n\nResearchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains. Efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways. The extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells, and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair. It increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury, promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and boosts the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body. Scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue.\n\nEfrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body. Pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage. \"A non-healing wound in the leg and a non-healing wound in the brain,\" he said, \"they are the same basic thing.\"\n\nEfrati came to the field accidentally. Eight years ago, as director of research at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tel Aviv, he was asked to oversee the hospital's small hyperbaric chamber. He knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn't especially interested in it. But he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect. A patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn't heal \u2014 a common symptom in diabetes. The man had also suffered a traumatic brain injury several years earlier, which left him unable to speak more than a few words. The hyperbaric treatment healed his feet \u2014 and also revived his ability to speak. Other patients with wounds and brain injuries had similar surprising results. He began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain, and this work has become his focus. In 2008. Efrati founded and now directs the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Tel Aviv University and Assaf Harofeh, where he oversees and collaborates with a range of scientists and manages a large hyperbaric treatment facility.\n\nAs the use of hyperbaric therapy for brain injury has grown, it has become increasingly controversial. Critics argue that it remains unproven and that desperate patients are wasting thousands of dollars \u2014 the treatment typically costs between $200 and $400 per session and is rarely covered by insurance \u2014 on a technique that rarely if ever helps. Between 2009 and 2015, Cifu oversaw three studies for the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2014 reportedly at a taxpayer cost of about $70 million \u2014 of about 60 active-duty service members with post-concussion syndrome. The studies found that hyperbaric treatment had little effect on their symptoms.\n\nOverall, there is relatively little research on hyperbaric treatment for brain injury, in part because pressurized oxygen can't be patented, which limits its potential profitability. \"It's very difficult to get funding for studies on this topic,\" Harch said.\n\nA few studies besides Cifu's have looked at humans. In a paper published in October, Efrati and colleagues examined 15 post-concussion syndrome patients who had received hyperbaric treatment. Using brain imaging, the scientists found that after treatment, the subjects had increased cerebral blood flow as well as more activity in brain areas that had previously been dormant. They say that this indicates that hyperbaric treatment triggered regeneration of nerve fibers and blood vessels in the brain. In addition, tests showed that the subjects had improved memory and processing speed. In another study, published in 2015, researchers gave hyperbaric oxygen to 56 patients with prolonged post-concussion syndrome. They found that many patients showed significant improvements in cognitive function and overall quality of life.\n\nWhile the research remains inconclusive, some American doctors are using oxygen to treat chronic brain injuries.\n\nZiad Mirza is one of them. For most of his career, he dispensed hyperbaric treatment for hospitals around Baltimore. Two years ago, he became chief medical officer for Hyperheal Hyperbarics, a company with three clinics in the Baltimore area. Since then, he said, he has treated about a half-dozen brain-injury patients, with mostly positive results.\n\nOne of these patients is Parisa Cook, 29, who in 2016 was found to have a tennis ball-size tumor in her brain. Surgeons removed it, but the operation was not a complete success. Cook, who lives in Baltimore, began to suffer from debilitating symptoms: She had problems with her short-term memory; she had constant headaches and couldn't concentrate; her vision became blurry and dark; and her hearing was altered, so that all sounds were jumbled and very loud. Specialists told her the operation probably had caused collateral brain trauma.\n\nOver the course of a year, she went to eight doctors and tried more than a dozen medications and a variety of other treatments. Nothing helped. A policy analyst for the Maryland Department of Health, she worried that she would have to quit her job. She began to consider suicide. \"I felt completely hopeless,\" she said.\n\nThen Cook read about hyperbaric oxygen treatment. She got in touch with Mirza and began treatments. After a single session, she said, her vision was no longer wobbly; after 20 sessions over a month, she felt \"perfect.\" \"It was a complete 180,\" she said. \"This treatment saved my life.\"\n\nCook's primary-care doctor, Sujay Pathak, an internist in Baltimore, first saw her in February. \"Her life was totally interrupted by this. She couldn't function,\" Pathak said.\n\nBut a few weeks after starting hyperbaric therapy in September, she \"got suddenly and rather miraculously better,\" Pathak said.\n\nOf course, such anecdotes are not the same as rigorous scientific research. Efrati agreed that hyperbaric treatment requires more research. \"Definitely, we need more science,\" he said. \"We have a lot to learn. But we are seeing the results with our patients. It works, again and again and again.\"\n\nHyperbaric wound treatment, often for diabetics, is booming.

This is Rachel, Epstein\u2019s 17-year-old daughter, born with Canavan disease\u2014a debilitating, fatal brain disorder. As a newborn, Rachel opened her mouth as if to scream but made no sound. As an infant, she never moved in her sleep. When Rachel failed to lift her head by six months of age, an early intervention therapist suspected she had cerebral palsy. Epstein wishes it had been so. Instead, Rachel had inherited a mutated version of a gene called ASPA from each of her parents. Without a healthy copy of that gene, her cells could not produce a protein needed to break down acid in the brain. So the acid built up, then slowly ate away at the insulation protecting Rachel\u2019s neurons, turning her white matter into a sponge pocketed with fluid-filled sacs.

Yet standing in a room at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Epstein holds a mouse that once had the same symptoms as Rachel\u2014but now runs effortlessly over her outstretched fingers. Weeks before, the mouse was treated with a single intravenous injection of a gene therapy drug developed in the lab of Gessler\u2019s doctoral adviser, microbiologist Guangping Gao. The drug is the fruit of Gao\u2019s 23-year career in gene therapy.\n\nGao did not always believe the drug would ever make it out of the laboratory, because the field of gene therapy has been plagued with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, including the deaths of test subjects. Over the past five years, however, there has been a resurgence of gene therapy in neuroscience. Scientists now argue it is our best, and perhaps only, chance at curing many diseases of the brain. And attuned to the multibillion-dollar potential of this new class of drugs, large pharmaceutical companies including Novartis, Shire, AstraZeneca and GSK are joining the fray. More than 20 biotech companies are currently developing viral gene therapies while others are working to directly edit genes.\n\n\u201cGene therapies are coming along fast and furious. They\u2019re going to earn their place,\u201d says Kevin Starr, co-founder of Third Rock Ventures, a venture capital firm invested in three gene therapy companies. \u201cWe are probably in the greatest innovative period of understanding human disease and how to make cures ever.\u201d\n\nThe concept of gene therapy is straightforward, beautiful even: Fix an illness caused by a faulty gene by replacing or supplementing a healthy new copy of the gene. In other words, use genes as medicine. For example, one of the earliest human tests of gene therapy was in 1990, when two young girls with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) received repeated infusions of their own white blood cells modified to fix a defective gene. It worked\u2014with continued treatments, both children showed signs of a restored immune system and went on to lead normal lives.\n\nGao first met a Canavan patient in 1993, at a party celebrating his discovery of the gene and mutations that caused the disorder. A family wheeled over their 6-year-old with Canavan disease to the young scientist, who realized that the boy had donated tissue to his research project. \u201cI\u2019d held his DNA in my hands. I had found what was wrong with his DNA,\u201d recalls Gao, then a Ph.D. student. Yet he had no way to fix it. At that moment, \u201cI knew what I would do for the rest of my life\u2014find a cure for the disease,\u201d says Gao. \u201cAnd other than gene therapy, there was no other way.\u201d\n\nGene therapy is well-suited for treating inherited brain diseases. First, most drugs can\u2019t get through the brain\u2019s formidable blood-brain barrier, but something small, like a virus with a healthy gene tucked inside, can do it. Additionally, the brain is a closed compartment, so the risks of gene therapy are minimized\u2014other parts of the body, the liver or the lungs, say, are undisturbed.\n\nIn the early \u201990s, Gao was a student without a lab of his own. So he sought out James Wilson at the University of Pennsylvania, a rising star in the field of gene therapy. For the next 13 years, Gao would work for Wilson, engineering new and better viruses for the therapies, called \u201cviral vectors.\u201d These molecular FedEx trucks can be loaded with healthy versions of genes and deliver them to the correct location in the body.\n\nGao was in the right place at the right time. By 1999, more than 115 gene therapy clinical trials were approved in the U.S, ranging in illnesses from cancer to blood disorders to graft-versus-host disease. Wilson eagerly moved from the lab into human trials, starting with five studies utilizing a modified version of an adenovirus, a common virus known to cause respiratory infections in people. One of those trials enrolled a teenager named Jesse Gelsinger.\n\nGelsinger suffered from a genetic liver condition kept under control with pills and diet, but he volunteered for the study to help find a cure for infants with a fatal form of his disorder. When Gelsinger received the gene therapy in September 1999, the adenoviral vector triggered a violent immune response that damaged his liver and shut down his lungs. Four days after the injection, he was dead.\n\nHis death shuttered gene therapy funding and research in the United States. Europeans continued on, buoyed by an announcement in 2000 that gene therapy had cured a group of 20 children with SCID. But within a few years, five of them had developed leukemia from the treatment. One died, and scientists fled the field. Gao, who was not directly involved in the clinical trial that led to Gelsinger\u2019s death, doesn\u2019t like to talk about it now, saying only that he doesn\u2019t blame Wilson. Gao kept his head down and quietly continued to work on other types of safer viral vectors.\n\nThe most promising candidate was adeno-associated virus (AAV)\u2014a virus that grows in the presence of adenovirus but is a completely different type. AAVs are not quite as efficient as adenoviruses at getting genes into human cells, but they are much safer: The human immune system barely notices the virus\u2019s outer coat or \u201cdress,\u201d as Gao calls it. And AAVs do not integrate into the genome of human cells, which is what caused leukemia in some of the SCID patients.\n\nIn 2008, Gao struck out on his own, taking a job as director of a brand-new gene therapy center at UMass. The paint on his office walls was still wet when Sherri Epstein walked in. A part-time administrative assistant in the building next door, Epstein had seen Gao\u2019s appointment in a local newspaper. Epstein introduced herself and told Gao about Rachel and her previous attempt at gene therapy. Five years earlier, doctors running the first-ever Canavan gene therapy trial drilled six tiny holes into Rachel\u2019s skull, inserted thin catheters and delivered their drug to parts of her brain. It was safe, but it didn\u2019t work.\n\nNot long after that initial meeting, Epstein brought Rachel to visit the lab. Once again, Gao was standing in front of a desperate parent and dying child.\n\nAt the time, only one gene therapy had been commercially approved in the world: a cancer drug in China. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe were highly skeptical of the safety and efficacy of such treatments. Gao knew he had to be careful and was determined to not repeat the errors of his predecessors by rushing into human trials. Instead, he spent the next eight years methodically producing a novel gene therapy for Canavan disease. He has spent over $2 million in federal and university research funds developing and testing it in hundreds of mice with the disease.\n\nGao's graduate student Seemin Ahmed initiated the lab work in 2010, and accomplished a proof-of-concept with a first-generation gene therapy that could partially rescue the disease, based on AAV9, an ideal AAV vector to get into the brain. The AAV9 therapy is so good at slipping into the brain that one can deliver the drug intravenously into the blood, and it passes through the blood-brain barrier to penetrate all areas of the brain. No drilling into the skull required. Gessler, a young German scientist studying to be a neurosurgeon, joined the project in 2012 and has since built on Ahmed's work, optimization the therapy with an improved gene construct that produces 10 times as many copies of the needed protein as earlier versions.\n\nGessler will never forget the first time he tested the optimized therapy in a live animal. He injected it into a young, sick mouse, hunched over with no control over its muscles. When Gessler returned to assess the results, he couldn\u2019t find the mouse. He worried he had mislabeled a cage. He hadn\u2019t. The mouse was there, acting just as healthy as the control mice.\n\nToday, the treatment has cured Canavan disease in two different strains of mice engineered to have the disease. A dozen freezers line the long hallway in Gao\u2019s laboratory, each filled to the brim with preserved tissues and viruses. \u201cWe have the therapy. We are ready,\u201d says Gao, grinning like a schoolchild. The last barrier is financial but not impossible to overcome. Gao estimates it will require $10 million to $12 million to launch the first human clinical trials\u2014but the potential profits are already attracting biotech attention. Two companies, which Gao declined to name, have approached him about getting involved in the effort.\n\nThe office of Voyager Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, epitomizes a trendy startup: glass doors, whiteboard walls, minimalist orange-accented d\u00e9cor and a communal area with free drinks and snacks. It smells like caffeine and money.\n\nBut unlike tech startups, this office is flanked on either side by laboratories full of microscopes and viruses. The company is developing gene therapies for a handful of central nervous system disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s and Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. Voyager CEO Steven Paul has worked in the pharmaceutical industry developing drugs for brain disorders for over 35 years and witnessed the tribulations of gene therapy. He\u2019s ardent that now is finally the right time.\n\nInvestors agree. Venture firms have invested more in gene therapy since 2010 than they did during the whole previous decade, and therapies for the brain far and away lead the pack, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Last February, when Voyager was just a year old, it inked a deal with Genzyme for $100 million up front and up to $745 million in future milestone payments, including for the company\u2019s severe brain disease programs. Voyager followed that with $60 million in investor financing in April and an $81 million initial public offering in November.

"annotations": []}, {"article": "WEDNESDAY, Sept. 1, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A drug widely used to treat high blood sugar in type 2 diabetics may hold some promise in the prevention of tobacco-induced lung cancer, according to extremely preliminary findings in a mouse study.\n\nIn the September issue of Cancer Prevention Research, researchers report that metformin was associated with a substantial reduction (up to 73 percent) in the number of tumors mice developed when they were given a common carcinogen found in tobacco.\n\nDespite the fact that there have been no randomized controlled trials on whether metformin really can prevent cancer, researchers expressed excitement both over this animal study and previous epidemiological evidence pointing to this possibility.\n\nMetformin (originally marketed as Glucophage, though it is now available as an inexpensive generic) has been in use for more than two decades and is currently prescribed to 40 million Americans.\n\n\"This is a very safe agent and has been around for a while,\" said Cancer Prevention Research editor-in-chief Dr. Scott Lippman, chair of thoracic head and neck medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, at a Wednesday news conference.\n\n\"The evidence in diabetic humans is very convincing and very strong,\" added Dr. Phillip Dennis, a senior investigator with the U.S. National Cancer Institute and senior author on the lung cancer paper. \"Almost every epidemiological study I can think of found a decreased cancer incidence in diabetics taking metformin. The reduction is real and ranges from 30 to 70 percent.\"\n\nThe researchers thought metformin's possible cancer-lowering properties suggested the need for clinical trials to investigate whether the drug might help prevent tumors in smokers at high risk of developing cancer. Others believed that the finding might influence the choice of drugs in people with diabetes.\n\n\"All other things being equal, many diabetics face a choice of oral agents, and early evidence that metformin may have an effect on the oncology side may increasingly play a role in decision-making,\" said Dr. Michael Pollack, professor of medicine and oncology at McGill University in Montreal. \"We can't ignore this, but we can't say we have FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] approval for metformin for cancer indications.\"\n\nMetformin was developed from the French lilac plant, known in the Middle Ages to control excess urination, a symptom of uncontrolled diabetes.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. Nearly one in three adults in the U.S. has prehypertension, blood pressure higher than normal but not considered high yet.\n\nThe scans detect levels of calcium in the heart's arteries, and the physicians suggest those people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.\n\nIn the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient.\n\n\"If a health care provider wants to target blood pressure in a patient with traditional heart disease risk factors and above-normal blood pressure, he or she can look at coronary artery calcium to help with tiebreakerlike decisions,\" says J. William McEvoy, M.B.B.Ch., M.H.S., assistant professor of medicine and member of the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"Our study, along with others, such as SPRINT and HOPE, positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target.\"\n\nIn late 2015, the SPRINT trial showed improved outcomes for participants with increased risk for heart disease whose physicians targeted their systolic (the top number) blood pressures to 120 millimeters of mercury, rather than the traditional 140 millimeters of mercury. But not all people deemed \"higher risk\" by traditional methods may need to be aggressively treated, McEvoy says. Some people react poorly to higher doses of blood pressure medicines and experience side effects, such as sexual dysfunction, dizziness, falls, weakness and more. And the risk factor equations that determine whether certain people are at higher risk and should be treated more intensively with blood pressure medications may have inaccuracies on the individual level, says McEvoy. \"We can predict that about 15 out of every 100 people with a particular risk score will die of a heart attack, but the equations don't tell us which of those people will be one of the actual 15; they don't give us personalized information,\" says McEvoy.\n\nConventionally, coronary artery calcium scores have informed physicians' decisions of whether to put a patient on statins, but the researchers say they haven't been evaluated before for their potential ability to determine blood pressure treatment. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Participants were an average of 65 years old, and 48 percent were men. Thirty-five percent were white, 32 percent were African-American, 22 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were Chinese-American. At the beginning of the study, investigators measured their blood pressure and performed a cardiac CT scan to determine coronary artery calcium scores. They also calculated each participant's heart disease risk with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Algorithm, which uses traditional risk factors, such as race, age, sex, cholesterol levels and family history of disease. About once a year for 10 years, an interviewer contacted each participant or a family member to determine heart disease diagnosis, hospitalizations or deaths. After about 10 years, the participants had 642 heart disease events, such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death.\n\nThe researchers divided the participants by their coronary artery calcium scores into one of three groups: those with a score of zero, those with a score of one to 100 and those with a score greater than 100. Then, they looked at the number of heart disease-related events in each calcium score category broken down by blood pressure range and calculated heart disease risk. Low heart disease risk was classified as a less than 15 percent chance of a heart disease event over the next 10 years, and high risk was 15 percent or greater risk of a heart disease event. To get the event rate, the investigators divided the number of events in each category by the amount of people in the study multiplied by the length of time they spent in the study, known as a person-year.\n\nParticipants with calcium scores of zero with a high calculated risk of heart disease had a relatively low actual event rate after the 10-year study. For example, according to the researchers, those with systolic blood pressures below 140 millimeters of mercury and no calcium had an event rate of 12.7 events per 1,000 person-years, and similar people with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 159 millimeters of mercury had an event rate of 13.6 events per 1,000 person-years.\n\nIn contrast, participants with systolic blood pressure under 140 millimeters of mercury -- below the current cutoff for treatment -- and rated with a low predicted risk of heart disease who had a calcium score over 100 had a high actual event rate of 19.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment.\n\nParticipants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores. The researchers say this demonstrates that calcium scores may only be useful in guiding more personalized blood pressure treatment for patients with mild high blood pressure -- the gray zone -- not those with high blood pressure.\n\n\"It may be that if patients are in that blood pressure treatment gray zone with a high risk score but their coronary artery calcium score is zero, then they don't need to be treated aggressively to 120 millimeters of mercury and can be treated to 140 instead,\" says McEvoy. \"But if patients have a high calcium score and are in the gray zone, then it would make sense to go with 120 as a treatment goal.\"\n\nThe researchers caution that results are from an observational study, and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations.\n\nCoronary artery calcium scans aren't usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from $100 to $400.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. Nearly one in three adults in the U.S. has prehypertension, blood pressure higher than normal but not considered high yet.", "The scans detect levels of calcium in the heart's arteries, and the physicians suggest those people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.", "In the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient.", "\"If a health care provider wants to target blood pressure in a patient with traditional heart disease risk factors and above-normal blood pressure, he or she can look at coronary artery calcium to help with tiebreakerlike decisions,\" says J.

But not all people deemed \"higher risk\" by traditional methods may need to be aggressively treated, McEvoy says. Some people react poorly to higher doses of blood pressure medicines and experience side effects, such as sexual dysfunction, dizziness, falls, weakness and more. And the risk factor equations that determine whether certain people are at higher risk and should be treated more intensively with blood pressure medications may have inaccuracies on the individual level, says McEvoy. \"We can predict that about 15 out of every 100 people with a particular risk score will die of a heart attack, but the equations don't tell us which of those people will be one of the actual 15; they don't give us personalized information,\" says McEvoy.", "Conventionally, coronary artery calcium scores have informed physicians' decisions of whether to put a patient on statins, but the researchers say they haven't been evaluated before for their potential ability to determine blood pressure treatment. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Participants were an average of 65 years old, and 48 percent were men. Thirty-five percent were white, 32 percent were African-American, 22 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were Chinese-American. At the beginning of the study, investigators measured their blood pressure and performed a cardiac CT scan to determine coronary artery calcium scores. They also calculated each participant's heart disease risk with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Algorithm, which uses traditional risk factors, such as race, age, sex, cholesterol levels and family history of disease. About once a year for 10 years, an interviewer contacted each participant or a family member to determine heart disease diagnosis, hospitalizations or deaths. After about 10 years, the participants had 642 heart disease events, such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death.", "The researchers divided the participants by their coronary artery calcium scores into one of three groups: those with a score of zero, those with a score of one to 100 and those with a score greater than 100. Then, they looked at the number of heart disease-related events in each calcium score category broken down by blood pressure range and calculated heart disease risk. Low heart disease risk was classified as a less than 15 percent chance of a heart disease event over the next 10 years, and high risk was 15 percent or greater risk of a heart disease event. To get the event rate, the investigators divided the number of events in each category by the amount of people in the study multiplied by the length of time they spent in the study, known as a person-year.", "Participants with calcium scores of zero with a high calculated risk of heart disease had a relatively low actual event rate after the 10-year study.

Neither had a painful bone-marrow transplant nor an experimental treatment. Her careworn father cried in the shower to hide his anguish. Her mother couldn\u2019t help but wonder, \u201cWhy is this happening to our child?\u201d\n\nBut Ava was fortunate in one respect. Discoveries in the burgeoning field of immunotherapy are offering lifelines to desperate patients who previously had none. \u201cFive years ago,\u201d said her mother, Bethany Christianson, \u201cour doctor would have just had to tell us to go home.\u201d\n\nInstead, in a five-minute procedure at the NIH Clinical Center in late July, the freckle-face girl got another chance to beat the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has stalked her since age 4. She was infused with 30 million of her own T cells, a key part of the immune system, that had been genetically modified to track down and kill her cancer like a pack of crazed dogs.\n\nAva\u2019s treatment, called CAR T-cell therapy, is one of the new immunotherapies that attempt to rally the body\u2019s own defenses to fight malignancies. Unlike other cancer advances, it is being tested widely in children because of its stunning effectiveness in ALL, the most common pediatric cancer. In early-stage trials, many patients who had repeatedly relapsed saw their leukemia disappear. Some remain cancer-free.\n\nYet big questions surround the therapy, and many scientists are urging caution. \u201cThere\u2019s very real promise with this approach, but the immune system is complicated,\u201d said Terry Fry, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) scientist who is running Ava\u2019s trial. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that still needs to be worked out.\u201d\n\n[Here\u2019s what you need to know about immunotherapy]\n\nComplications can be lethal; one clinical trial was briefly halted in July after three young adults died of brain swelling. It is also far from clear that such a personalized approach \u2014 possibly costing hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 is economically viable on a large scale or will produce the lasting remissions that everyone hopes to see.\n\nU.S. researchers running CAR T-cell trials for children and adults with leukemia and lymphoma have reported remission rates up to 90 percent in some cases. That\u2019s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. But rates in other trials are considerably lower, and many patients eventually relapse.\n\n\u201cThe treatment is great about getting people into remission but not at keeping everyone in remission,\u201d said Rebecca Gardner, a pediatric oncologist at Seattle Children\u2019s hospital. She ran an early-stage trial using CAR T-cell therapy in which 39 of 42 patients went into complete remission. By a year, about half had relapsed, either because their T cells had inexplicably disappeared or their cancer had changed so that the T cells could no longer recognize it. \u201cLeukemia is really smart,\u201d she said.\n\nAva\u2019s family understands that better than most. She underwent her first CAR T-cell procedure in Minnesota last year, but her leukemia returned within six months. Her treatment at NIH involved a next-generation version, developed by NCI, that used a different target for her marauding T cells. In this first-in-humans trial, she is Patient No. 18.\n\nIn late August, the Christiansons learned that Ava had gone into remission. She and her mother, who were still at the Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., gleefully rushed home to Wisconsin so Ava could start third grade.\n\nHer parents, so frequently disappointed, remain guardedly optimistic. \u201cHope is all you have,\u201d said her father, Jay Christianson.\n\nHer mother added, \u201cWe just need this to work and to stay working.\u201d\n\nNCI\u2019s Fry is careful not to make any promises about an extended remission. \u201cI can\u2019t say that\u2019s going to be the case,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d\n\nScientists have wanted for decades to marshal the immune system to vanquish cancer, but their attempts have mostly been frustrated. In the past few years, however, breakthroughs have led to the development of two types of immunotherapy \u2014 checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T cells \u2014 that are generating enormous excitement.\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors are off-the-shelf therapies aimed at unleashing the immune system\u2019s power to see and attack the disease. Used mostly in adults, to date, they are producing impressive results, albeit in a minority of cases. The most prominent: Jimmy Carter. The former president became the poster patient when he was successfully treated last year with a checkpoint inhibitor called Keytruda, along with surgery and radiation, for his advanced melanoma.\n\nMuch of the earliest research for customized CAR T-cell therapy was conducted at NCI, the University of Pennsylvania, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Seattle Children\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe technology of CAR T cells is really a breakthrough, especially for children,\u201d said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute.\n\nAlmost all the initial work focused on CD19, a protein found on the surface of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Scientists figured out ways to use a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, to reprogram T cells to recognize the protein and kill the cancer.\n\n[Immunotherapy is showing benefits in an increasing number of cancers]\n\nZane Esposito, a 13-year-old from Plano, Tex., calls himself the \u201cT-Cell Explorer.\u201d He was diagnosed with ALL in June 2010. \u201cI just thought my back hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk up the steps very well.\u201d Almost three years of treatment, including punishing chemotherapy, provided a couple of years of remission. His leukemia returned in January, and this time it did not respond to treatment.\n\nSoon after Zane relapsed, he and his father bumped into friends in a local doughnut shop who told them about a TV segment on CAR T-cell therapy. Paul Esposito searched online and found Gardner\u2019s clinical trial in Seattle. Zane signed on, got the treatment, went back into full remission and gained 25 pounds.\n\nHis Texas doctors have talked about a bone-marrow transplant to increase the chance of a true cure, but the Espositos have resisted. The Seattle doctors say it is not clear yet whether that is necessary or whether there would be still other options should Zane\u2019s cancer recur.\n\nZane is moving on, with dreams of competing on \u201cChopped Junior\u201d to show off his homemade pasta and pizza. On July 27, the day that Ava got her T cells, he celebrated his 13th birthday.\n\nAva was 4 when she started having leg pains, then trouble standing up. Her mother suspected Lyme disease. \u201cYou never think of cancer with a child,\u201d she said, eyes filling as she recalled her daughter\u2019s cancer diagnosis in November 2012. The doctors assured the family that it was typical leukemia \u2014 and curable.\n\nLike most children, Ava quickly went into remission after starting the prescribed 30 months of chemotherapy. But at home in Prescott, a small Wisconsin city at the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, things did not get easier for the Christiansons. In early 2013, Ava was hospitalized in Minneapolis for a lung infection. About the same time, the couple\u2019s second daughter, Audrey, was born 13 weeks premature and hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit in St. Paul. Bethany, who manages occupational therapists for a nursing-home chain, and Jay, a rural mail carrier, shuttled between the Twin Cities visiting their daughters.\n\n\u201cI would be with Ava during the day, and then when Jay got home, he would stay with Ava, and I would spend time with Audrey,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what you do, you feel like a bad mom.\u201d\n\nA year or so after treatment began, Ava relapsed. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. Her doctors arranged for a bone-marrow transplant, with her baby sister as the donor.\n\nThe transplant made her sick and the whole family miserable. Ava spent months in the hospital and then a year at home. Because of fears of infection, she couldn\u2019t go out much. She missed all of first grade. But her parents had hope that the transplant would keep her cancer at bay.\n\n[Brain cancer now the leading cause of cancer deaths in children]\n\nAt a six-month checkup, tests showed that the leukemia was back again. There were no more conventional treatments to try. But because of her two relapses, Ava was now eligible for a CAR T-cell trial at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital. Her T cells would be genetically altered to go after CD19.The number of cells then would be vastly increased and reinfused.\n\nIt sounded like science fiction, but Bethany Christianson found comfort in talking to the father of Emily Whitehead. In 2012, the 6-year-old Pennsylvania girl became the first child to be treated with reprogrammed T cells for leukemia. She has been in remission ever since.\n\nAva got her treatment in April 2015 \u2014 after her cells were extracted via a tube inserted into her neck \u2014 and five days later had a massive immune reaction with a high fever and intense pain. While that is typical, some patients become dangerously ill. Yet Ava recovered fast, went into remission and attended summer school, where she learned how to make pigs-in-a-blanket and wrote her own cookbook.\n\nBy then, her parents had gotten used to living in the midst of remissions and relapses. \u201cWhen she felt better, we would do everything we could,\u201d Bethany said. They visited Robot World, a scientifically themed attraction a few hours from Prescott. \u201cYou don\u2019t put things off, because you are always thinking, \u2018What if?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLast fall, doctors delivered the bad news. Ava\u2019s cancer had changed. It was no longer producing the CD19 protein, which meant her modified T cells could no longer recognize the disease. But the leukemia was still producing another common protein, called CD22, and that offered an opportunity.\n\nAs it happened, Fry, head of the blood-cancer section in NCI\u2019s pediatric oncology branch, had already launched the world\u2019s first trial using CAR T-cell therapy to focus on CD22. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy\u2019s impact, researchers thought. At the time, they did not realize that a significant percentage of patients in the other trials might relapse because of changes in their cancer.\n\nFry insisted as he designed the study that children be included, despite ever-present concerns about exposing them to safety risks. He wanted to avoid a delay in testing what could be a lifesaving pediatric treatment. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take two to three years on adults, and then go back and do children,\u201d he said.\n\n[For a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine\u2019s hottest field]\n\nThe clinical trial already has treated nearly two dozen leukemia and lymphoma patients through age 30. The majority have gone into remission, although some have had their cancer return. While it is far too early to know long-term outcomes, Fry said he is convinced the CD22 treatment holds much potential. He is planning another trial next year with the Stanford University School of Medicine. It will target both proteins \u2014 CD19 and CD22 \u2014 simultaneously.\n\nOnce Ava relapsed after the Minnesota trial, Fry\u2019s study at the NIH Clinical Center appeared to be the only option. But there was no slot immediately available. With Ava deteriorating, doctors put her on an experimental treatment that sent her into remission but had serious side effects.\n\nThey immediately stopped the medication when they learned Ava might get her T-cell therapy in January \u2014 she actually needed a high level of leukemia in her body to participate. But on this wrenching roller coaster of research and treatment, it turned out that she still had to wait several more months.\n\nAva\u2019s cancer returned in June. Her T cells were extracted in preparation for the trial, even as she got sicker and sicker.\n\nShe was admitted to the Clinical Center in mid-July, to a room with dancing penguins painted on the windows.

By the end of the six-month study, patients who had received the text messages had reduced their cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index.\n\n\"I have to say, we were pretty surprised that it worked,\" says Clara Chow, lead author of the study and program director of community-based cardiac services at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia.\n\nAnd it worked to improve not just one risk factor for heart disease, but many. \"These are the things that medications usually do, not text messages,\" says Chow, who is also an associate professor at Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney.\n\nIn a randomized clinical trial, more than 700 patients with coronary heart disease were split into two groups: half received four text messages per week for six months plus usual care, while the other half received just usual care.\n\nThe texts that patients received were semi-personalized, based on background information about each person, such as smoking status and preferred name. For example, vegetarian participants wouldn't receive the text message about how grilling steak is healthier than deep-frying it.\n\nOther texts might include something like, \"Hi, Elizabeth. Have you gone for your walk today?\" or \"Have you taken your medications yet today? It's important to take them at the same time each day.\"\n\nThere's a lot of hype over mobile health interventions these days, Chow says. \"Everyone thinks it has a lot of potential, but there's actually very little evidence.\"\n\nWhile there are more than 100,000 health-related apps on the market, the evidence to date is lacking as to whether many of those apps are safe or effective, according to Zubin Eapen, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine.\n\n\"We [as physicians] are always looking for evidence to make sure that we are recommending the right things for our patients, whether it's a drug, a device or a digital product, like an app,\" says Eapen, who is also medical director of the Duke Heart Failure Same-Day Access Clinic.\n\nEapen coauthored an editorial, which was published alongside Chow's study, with Eric Peterson, the Fred Cobb Distinguished Professor of Medicine in the division of cardiology at Duke and an associate editor of JAMA.\n\nNot only does this research provide evidence that a text-based program can improve heart disease risk factors, but it also shows that a bunch of bells and whistles aren't required for successful health outcomes. A simple, low-cost program of text messaging can do the trick.\n\n\"I like to look for things that are able to be used in multiple corners of our world, from low-income settings to high-income settings,\" Chow says. \"Everybody owns a mobile phone these days. You don't have to have a smartphone to text.\"\n\nThat means more access across more sectors of a population.

It can be hard to view those everyday decisions in light of more distant consequences, like having another heart attack or not living as long a life as desired. Encouraging text messages may help to inform those everyday decisions and keep a bigger goal in mind.\n\nChow and Eapen say the study has its limitations. It can't tell us whether text messaging could eventually lead to fewer subsequent heart attacks among the patients receiving those messages or whether the positive health outcomes would continue past the six-month study window. Yet patients in Chow's study resoundingly said that the text messaging helped them make the necessary changes \u2013 more than 90 percent of the participants found the program useful.\n\n\"People said things like, 'It wasn't actually what the messages said, it was that someone was there supporting me, thinking about me,' \" Chow says.\n\nAnd although Chow and her colleagues told study participants that they did not need to reply to the text messages, many of them still did. \"Heaps of them replied to us,\" she says. \"They would say, 'Thanks for the message.

The story does not explicitly address cost, except to call text messaging \u201ca scalable and affordable approach.\u201d For many (or most) patients, the cost of receiving four text messages a week would likely be negligible \u2014 covered by an individual\u2019s phone plan or by nominal text rates. However, not everyone owns a mobile phone, a fact that makes access (and cost) a more significant issue.\u00a0However, the story does deliver on this point. The story discusses both the number of U.S. adults who own mobile phones (90 percent) and the fact that text messages are more accessible than other forms of mobile health communication (such as apps, which require patients to own smartphones or other smart devices).
