Last year, 2.3 million young Europeans (aged 15 to 34) used cocaine, and the US National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that 1.4 million Americans suffer from cocaine addiction1.

We have continued to follow patients from the trial, and the improvement seems to be sustained over time, up to 12 months, although we don't have any hard data on that yet. It is important that this is taken forward to a larger trial.\n\nWe decided to target an area of the brain involved in decision making, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL PFC). This was because previous animal studies from our lab had shown that compulsive cocaine-seeking was associated with hypoactivity in the prelimbic cortex, which is a brain area that shares similar behavioural roles to the DL PFC.

ills, the answer is \"yes,\" at least for a while.\n\nThey are trying something called the low-FODMAP diet, an experimental eating plan developed in Australia and now getting some scientific backing and commercial buzz in the United States. The diet is aimed primarily at people with irritable bowel syndrome, a common condition in which abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits \u2014 with diarrhea, constipation or both \u2014 can wax and wane for years.\n\nFollowers are asked to eliminate, and then try to reintroduce, a long list of foods containing certain carbohydrates that might trigger gas, bloating, pain and diarrhea. FODMAP is an acronym for those carbohydrates: fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols.\n\nThe theory is that FODMAPs, found in many fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy foods and sweeteners, are poorly digested by susceptible people. The undigested carbohydrates can draw extra fluid into the digestive tract and end up in the colon, where they are \u201cfeasted upon\u201d and fermented by gut microbes, leading to all sorts of misery, says Lauren Van Dam, a registered dietitian at the University of Michigan.\n\nIf giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. \u201cWe have some patients that are literally housebound because they are worried they are going to have an accident or because they have terrible pain,\u201d Van Dam says.\n\nBarbara DeLancey, a 63-year-old registered nurse from Ann Arbor, says she was crippled by 10-times-a-day diarrhea when she agreed to try the diet a year ago. \u201cI was resistant at first because it seemed so restrictive,\u201d she says. She got teary-eyed at the grocery store, seeing all the food she could not have.\n\nBut eventually she learned she could tolerate and add back some favorites, including garlic and apples. She credits the diet, along with medication, with a big reduction in her symptoms, but says \u201cit has not been a miracle cure.\u201d\n\nThe diet has generated enough interest to prompt some food companies to introduce low-FODMAP products \u2014 hoping for a market surpassing that for gluten-free foods, according to some industry reports.\n\nIn 2014, IBS treatment guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology said the diet showed promise, but that the quality of evidence was \u201cvery low.\"\n\nSince then, several studies have strengthened the case for the diet, says guideline co-author Brian Lacy, a professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, N.H. Still, one study from Sweden showed no advantage over a less-restrictive dietary approach that eliminates fewer foods and stresses changes such as smaller, more frequent meals.\n\n\"The data are not overwhelming,\u201d Lacy says. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a reasonable thing to try.\u201d\n\nThe largest study so far, with 92 patients, was conducted at University of Michigan. It found that 52% of low-FODMAP patients and 41% of patients on a less-restrictive diet reported \u201cadequate relief.\u201d The difference was not statistically significant, says study co-author William Chey, a professor of gastroenterology. But low-FODMAP patients did get significantly better relief from pain and bloating and greater gains in mood, body image and overall quality of life, he says.\n\nMedications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say.\n\nIt\u2019s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run \u2014 especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians.\n\n\u201cPhysicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,\u201d Chey says. Ideally, all would be referred to dietitians, Chey and Lacy agree. But few dietitians are trained in the diet, and insurers typically do not cover the visits, Lacy notes.\n\nWhen patients do make their way to Kate Scarlata, a Boston area registered dietitian who specializes in the diet, the first thing she tells them is that it \u201cis a dietary experiment.

Neoptolemos, of the Cancer Research U.K. Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit at the University of Liverpool in England, and colleagues.\n\nThe study authors noted that, currently, the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor, with a five-year survival rate of less than 5 percent. Surgery to remove cancerous tissue can boost the odds to as much as 10 percent, however, and there is active search underway to improve a patient's chances even more by adding in additional chemotherapy following surgery.\n\nThe pool of nearly 1,100 patients that the researchers focused on were part of the large European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial that took place across 159 pancreatic cancer centers located in Europe, Canada, Australasia and Japan.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the participants were divided into one of two six-month chemotherapy groups: one receiving fluorouracil and folinic acid post-surgery and the other receiving gemcitabine.\n\nAfter nearly three years of treatment, the researchers found almost no difference between survival rates in the two groups.\n\nThose who received fluorouracil and folinic acid chemotherapy had lived an average of 23 months. At the one- and two-year markers, survival rates for that group was approximately 78.5 and 48 percent, respectively.\n\nAt the three-year mark, patients on the gemcitabine regimen achieved an average survival rate of 23.6 months. One- and two-year survival rates were 80 and 49 percent, respectively, the investigators found.\n\n\"In conclusion, gemcitabine did not result in improved overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus folinic acid in patients with [surgically removed] pancreatic cancer,\" the authors concluded in their report.\n\nHowever, the team did observe one appreciable difference: patients on gemcitabine were less likely to experience serious side effects as a result of their chemotherapy treatment than those on the fluorouracil/folinic acid treatment (7.5 percent versus 14 percent).\n\nDr. Michael Choti, a professor of surgery and oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the study as \"important,\" but he does not believe it will alter the current approach to post-surgical chemotherapy.\n\n\"Really in the scope of things following major surgery, both are fairly tolerable regimens, and this study doesn't necessarily change the pattern of use in terms of choosing post-operative therapy,\" Choti said.\n\n\"But the point is that pancreatic cancer is a terrible disease, and really just a minority of patients are candidates for surgery. And even for those, unfortunately 75 to 80 percent of those will go on to recur even after the surgery appears to be successful. So, indeed, there has been a strong interest in giving the best additional therapy possible,\" Choti added.\n\n\"So this is not a revolutionary finding, but it's part of an effort to look at what we have and even to find newer regimens with more combinations of drugs,\" he noted. \"And that's exactly what's already underway, as we search for more aggressive and more successful treatments.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more information on pancreatic cancer.", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

treatment for hot flashes -- which has included the use of soy products, Chinese herbs and hypnosis -- has hit another roadblock.\n\nA new study of acupuncture by Mayo Clinic researchers has found that sham treatments were no better than real acupuncture in relieving the daily drenching sweats that some women find disabling during menopause.\n\nThe new research, presented last month at the

The research was only meant to show that, so far, it seems feasible and safe.\n\nThe concept was based on the astonishing case of an AIDS patient who seems to be cured after getting blood cells from a donor with natural immunity to HIV nearly four years ago in Berlin. Researchers are seeking a more practical way to achieve similar immunity using patients' own blood cells.\n\nThe results announced Monday at a conference in Boston left experts cautiously excited.\n\n\"For the first time, people are beginning to think about a cure\" as a real possibility, said Dr. John Zaia, head of the government panel that oversees gene therapy experiments. Even if the new approach doesn't get rid of HIV completely, it may repair patients' immune systems enough that they can control the virus and not need AIDS medicines - \"what is called a functional cure,\" he said.\n\nCarl Dieffenbach, AIDS chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n\"We're hopeful that this is sufficient to give the level of immune reconstitution similar to what was seen with the patient from Germany,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts tried to add a gene or muffle the activity of one, and have not worked against HIV.\n\nThe virus can damage the immune system for years before people develop symptoms and are said to have AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The virus targets special immune system soldiers called T-cells. It usually enters these cells through a protein receptor, or \"docking station,\" called CCR5.\n\nSome people (about 1 percent of whites; fewer of minorities) lack both copies of the CCR5 gene and are naturally resistant to HIV. One such person donated blood stem cells in 2007 to an American man living in Berlin who had leukemia and HIV.\n\nThe cell transplant appears to have cured both problems, but finding such donors for everyone with HIV is impossible, and transplants are medically risky.\n\nSo scientists wondered: Could a patient's own cells be used to knock out the CCR5 gene and create resistance to HIV?\n\nA California biotechnology company, Sangamo (SANG-uh-moh) BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can cut DNA at precise locations and permanently \"edit out\" a gene.\n\nDr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nHe warned that it would be \"way overstated\" to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure.\n\n\"It's an overreach of the data. There are a lot of people out there with hopes and dreams around the C-word,\" so caution is needed.\n\nIn the study, six men with HIV had their blood filtered to remove a small percentage of their T-cells. The gene-snipping compound was added in the lab, and about one-fourth of the cells were successfully modified. The cells were mixed with growth factors to make them multiply and then infused back into the patients.\n\nThree men received about 2.5 billion modified cells. Three others received about 5 billion.\n\nThree months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. As much as 6 percent of their total T-cells appear to be the new type - resistant to HIV, Lalezari said.\n\nThe sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected.

[Brown University] -- New results from a clinical trial involving more than 900 military veterans at high risk for keratinocyte carcinoma skin cancer provides evidence that using the generic skin cream fluorouacil 5 percent for two to four weeks may reduce the risk of a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) needing surgery by 75 percent within a year.\n\nThe finding that less than one month's use of fluorouacil 5% (5-FU) appeared to prevent cancer for up to a year is encouraging, said lead author Dr. Martin A. Weinstock, a professor of dermatology in the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and chief of dermatology at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\nThe dose is the same as dermatologists currently employ to treat actinic keratosis. In a 2015 study, Weinstock and co-authors showed the up to four-week regimen of 5-FU had a multi-year preventive benefit in reducing the number of actinic keratosis (AK) and the need for treatment. Earlier this year, they also showed that the medicine prevents new AKs from emerging for two to three years.\n\nMeanwhile, current means for preventing new carcinomas in high-risk patients -- sunscreen or oral medications -- cease to work as soon as they are no longer used. But in the new study, 5-FU appeared to provide prolonged protection after discontinuation and could be combined with sunscreen, Weinstock said.\n\nIn the absence of such a long-lasting prevention option, he said, the typical approach to caring for patients with a history of prior carcinomas is to monitor for the next cancer and then remove it surgically -- an effective but imposing strategy often called \"wait and cut.\"\n\n\"People don't appreciate having stuff cut on their face a lot,\" said Weinstock, who led the trial funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and conducted at a dozen V.A. hospitals around the country. \"They do it if there is a cancer there, but we want to take a proactive approach where we can give them something to reduce their risk of getting new cancers.\"\n\nThe new results are published in JAMA Dermatology.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial randomly assigned 932 veterans who each had at least two prior basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) or SCCs to either receive the 5-FU cream or a cream just like it but without the active ingredient as an experimental control. All of the veterans were instructed to apply their cream twice a day to their face and ears for up to four weeks. They also received a 30 SPF sunscreen and received education about skin cancer, sunscreen and sun safety.\n\nThe two groups were both almost exclusively white and male, and they averaged 71 years of age. The experimental and control groups were very similar along all other measured characteristics, including their self- reported degree of prior sun exposure and sunburn. Veterans typically have spent a large amount of time in the sun during their years of service.\n\nBoth groups went to their V.A. center twice a year for two to four years for follow-up exams with a dermatologist. Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo.\n\nAfter the first year, 20 of the 464 veterans in the control group developed a squamous cell carcinoma that required surgery, but only five of the 468 veterans who got 5-FU did, a statistically significant 75 percent reduction in the risk, according to the study. For the subsequent three years, there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who required surgical treatment for an SCC.\n\nFor BCCs, there was an 11 percent reduced risk after the first year among the group that received 5-FU, but that difference was not statistically significant. In the second year, BCC cases requiring surgery rose in the 5-FU group, but in years three and four, and by the end of the study, there was no significant overall difference in risk of developing a BCC requiring surgical treatment. After four years, 298 of all study the participants had developed at least one BCC, and 108 had developed at least one SCC.\n\nThe study did show a significant decrease in the risk of needing Mohs surgery to treat a BCC in the first year. Mohs surgery is more effective but also more elaborate and expensive than a conventional procedure, Weinstock said. In the study's first year, 36 BCCs were treated with Mohs surgery in 27 participants in the control group, but only 17 BCCs were treated with the procedure among 14 patients in the 5-FU group.\n\n\"This suggests that using the 5-FU can reduce the resources needed to treat these carcinomas,\" Weinstock said.\n\nThe cream does have common side effects including reddened, more sensitive and often crusty skin, effects that resolve when the application of the cream stops, Weinstock acknowledged. After the study's first six months, 21 percent of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as \"severe,\" and 40 percent rated them as \"moderate.\"\n\nBut after six months and again at the end of the four-year trial, 87 percent of participants in the 5-FU group said they'd be willing to repeat the treatment if it proved effective in reducing skin cancer.\n\nIn his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year.\n\n\"The most remarkable thing about this study is that now we have something to use that doesn't lose its effectiveness when you stop using it,\" Weinstock said. \"But this is the first study of its type.

people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease found that a biomarker that declines when the disease progresses was stabilized in people who took the purified form of resveratrol.\n\nResveratrol is a naturally occurring compound found in foods such as red grapes, raspberries, dark chocolate and some red wines.\n\nThe results, published online today in Neurology, \"are very interesting,\" says the study's principal investigator, R. Scott Turner, MD, PhD, director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center. Turner, who treats patients at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, cautions that the findings cannot be used to recommend resveratrol. \"This is a single, small study with findings that call for further research to interpret properly.\"\n\nThe resveratrol clinical trial was a randomized, phase II, placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. An \"investigational new drug\" application was required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to test the pure synthetic (pharmaceutical-grade) resveratrol in the study. It is not available commercially in this form.\n\nThe study enrolled 119 participants. The highest dose of resveratrol tested was one gram by mouth twice daily -- equivalent to the amount found in about 1,000 bottles of red wine.\n\nJohn Bozza, 80, participated in the study. Five years ago, his wife, Diana, began noticing \"something wasn't quite right.\" He was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, but only a year later, his condition progressed to mild Alzheimer's.\n\nDiana, whose twin sister died from the same disease, says there are multiple reasons she and John decided to participate in the resveratrol study, and they now know he was assigned to take the active drug.\n\n\"I definitely want the medical community to find a cure,\" she says. \"And of course I thought there's always a chance that John could have been helped, and who knows, maybe he was.\"\n\nPatients, like John, who were treated with increasing doses of resveratrol over 12 months showed little or no change in amyloid-beta40 (Abeta40) levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. In contrast, those taking a placebo had a decrease in the levels of Abeta40 compared with their levels at the beginning of the study.\n\n\"A decrease in Abeta40 is seen as dementia worsens and Alzheimer's disease progresses; still, we can't conclude from this study that the effects of resveratrol treatment are beneficial,\" Turner explains. \"It does appear that resveratrol was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier, which is an important observation. Resveratrol was measured in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid.\"\n\nThe researchers studied resveratrol because it activates proteins called sirtuins, the same proteins activated by caloric restriction. The biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's is aging, and studies with animals found that most age-related diseases--including Alzheimer's--can be prevented or delayed by long-term caloric restriction (consuming two-thirds the normal caloric intake).\n\nTurner says the study also found that resveratrol was safe and well tolerated. The most common side effects experienced by participants were gastrointestinal-related, including nausea and diarrhea. Also, patients taking resveratrol experienced weight loss while those on placebo gained weight.\n\nOne outcome in particular was confounding, Turner notes. The researchers obtained brain MRI scans on participants before and after the study, and found that resveratrol-treated patients lost more brain volume than the placebo-treated group.\n\n\"We're not sure how to interpret this finding. A similar decrease in brain volume was found with some anti-amyloid immunotherapy trials,\" Turner adds. A working hypothesis is that the treatments may reduce inflammation (or brain swelling) found with Alzheimer's.\n\nThe study, funded by the National Institute on Aging and conducted with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, began in 2012 and ended in 2014. GUMC was one of 21 participating medical centers across the U.S.\n\nFurther studies, including analysis of frozen blood and cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients, are underway to test possible drug mechanisms.\n\n\"Given safety and positive trends toward effectiveness in this phase 2 study, a larger phase 3 study is warranted to test whether resveratrol is effective for individuals with Alzheimer's -- or at risk for Alzheimer's,\" Turner says.\n\nResveratrol and similar compounds are being tested in many age-related disorders including cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. The study Turner led, however, is the largest, longest and highest dose trial of resveratrol in humans to date.\n\nThe research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging (U01 AG010483).

The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V. because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. The new genes program the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia.\n\nThe altered T-cells \u2014 called chimeric antigen receptor cells \u2014 are then dripped back into the patient\u2019s veins, and if all goes well they multiply and start destroying the cancer.\n\nThe T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells, whether they are healthy or malignant.\n\nA sign that the treatment is working is that the patient becomes terribly ill, with raging fevers and chills \u2014 a reaction that oncologists call \u201cshake and bake,\u201d Dr. June said. Its medical name is cytokine-release syndrome, or cytokine storm, referring to the natural chemicals that pour out of cells in the immune system as they are being activated, causing fevers and other symptoms. The storm can also flood the lungs and cause perilous drops in \u2014 effects that nearly killed Emma.\n\nSteroids sometimes ease the reaction, but they did not help Emma. Her temperature hit 105. She wound up on a ventilator, unconscious and swollen almost beyond recognition, surrounded by friends and family who had come to say goodbye.\n\nBut at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Doctors had never seen such a spike before and thought it might be what was making her so sick.\n\nDr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 \u2014 his daughter takes it for . It had never been used for a crisis like Emma\u2019s, but there was little to lose. Her oncologist, Dr. Stephan A. Grupp, ordered the drug.

With a pill, you take it, it\u2019s eliminated from your body and you have to take it again.\u201d But T-cells, he said, \u201ccould potentially be given only once, maybe only once or twice or three times.\u201d\n\nThe Pennsylvania researchers said they were surprised to find any big drug company interested in their work, because a new batch of T-cells must be created for each patient \u2014 a far cry from the familiar commercial strategy of developing products like or medicines, in which millions of people take the same drug.\n\nBut Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. Such home-run drugs can be approved more quickly and efficiently, he said, with smaller studies than are needed for drugs with less obvious benefits.\n\nBut such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage.\n\nDr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient \u2014 far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, \u201cOur costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.\u201d\n\nThe research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails. One patient had a remission after being treated only twice, and even then the reaction was so delayed that it took the researchers by surprise. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. The child who had a temporary remission apparently relapsed because not all of her leukemic cells had the marker that was targeted by the altered T-cells.\n\nIt is not clear whether a patient\u2019s body needs the altered T-cells forever. The cells do have a drawback: they destroy healthy B-cells as well as cancerous ones, leaving patients vulnerable to certain types of infections, so Emma and the other patients need regular treatments with immune globulins to prevent illness.\n\nSo far, her parents say, Emma seems to have taken it all in stride. She went back to school this year with her second-grade classmates, and though her grades are high and she reads about 50 books a month, she insists impishly that her favorite subjects are lunch and recess.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for her to be a kid again and get her childhood back,\u201d Mr. Whitehead said.", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Sixty-six had \u201cmild cognitive impairment,\u201d which falls somewhere between normal forgetfulness and dementia.\n\nBaker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age.\n\nBut recent work by one of Baker\u2019s co-authors hints that nasal sprays with the hormone insulin may have a positive impact on memory in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease - although that\u2019s far from conclusive yet.\n\nGHRH, a hormone produced by the hypothalamus in the brain, is linked to the insulin system, but also has a host of other effects. It dwindles naturally with aging, which has been linked to declines in memory and executive function.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is supplement that hormone and it then will result in a whole cascade of effects that then restore an aging system to a younger system,\u201d said Baker.\n\nIn her study, people injected a synthetic version of GHRH or a placebo daily for five months. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the test differences will translate into real life, said Baker. One test, for instance, asked participants to name the color of a font - say, green - used to write the name of a different color - say, \u201cred\u201d. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day.\n\nThe researchers found no serious side effects in the study, although people who got the hormone more often complained of symptoms like skin reactions and joint pain.\n\nStill, both Baker and Petersen said more work is needed to gauge the long-term consequences of GHRH injections. It\u2019s possible health problems could show up down the road, and the mental boost may be short-lived.\n\n\u201cIs it going to work in the long run and is it going to be safe?

These studies will be presented at the American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting, taking place May 5-9 in New York, NY.\n\nData from a study in adults with treatment-resistant depression showed that flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically meaningful rapid reduction of depressive symptoms as compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. The study defined treatment-resistant as patients who had not responded to two or more currently available antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression.\n\nData from a second study, in elderly patients aged 65 and older with treatment-resistant depression, which is the first study of its kind, showed treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated clinically meaningful effects compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint.\n\nIf approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), esketamine would be one of the first new approaches to treat refractory major depressive disorder available to patients in the last 50 years.\n\n\"With about 30 percent of patients with major depression failing to respond to currently available antidepressants1, treatment-resistant depression represents a major public health need,\" said Husseini K. Manji, MD, Global Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"The positive Phase 3 results for esketamine nasal spray in adults with treatment-resistant depression are exciting, particularly as they mark the first time an antidepressant has achieved superiority versus an active comparator in any clinical trial for major depressive disorder. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. We are also pleased with the clinically meaningful outcomes for esketamine nasal spray in elderly patients, a population that often has greater disability and lower response rates.\"\n\n\"There's a critical need for new, rapidly acting and effective treatment options for people with major depressive disorder who do not respond to existing therapies,\" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. \"Janssen is fully committed to exploring the newest science in the area of mood disorders and bringing these discoveries to patients in need.\"\n\nResults of the Study in Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression \n\n In the Phase 3 study of adults with treatment-resistant depression, patients were randomized to flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 mg or 84 mg) added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, demonstrated the statistically significant clinical improvement in patients' depressive symptoms for esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant at day 28 (Least Squares Mean Difference Standard Error from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -4.0 [1.69], 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -7.31, -0.64; one-sided p=0.010).\n\nSecondary and Other Efficacy Endpoints\n\nThe first key secondary endpoint (onset of clinical response by 24 hours post-dose that is maintained through day 28) numerically favored esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant vs. placebo nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant, but did not meet statistical significance (1-sided p=0.161). The other two key secondary endpoints (Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS], a subject-reported outcome measure widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], a self-report scale assessing depressive symptoms) could not be formally evaluated since onset of clinical response was not statistically significant. Among other endpoints, response rate was notable with 69.3% responding in the esketamine group vs. 52% in the placebo group at 28 days (response \u2265 50% improvement in MADRS from baseline). Remission rate (MADRS total score \u226412) at day 28 was 52.5% and 31.0% for the esketamine and placebo groups, respectively.\n\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were metallic taste, nausea, vertigo, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, dissociation, blurred vision, paraesthesia (tingling sensation) and anxiety. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the placebo group were metallic taste and headache.\n\nResults of the Study in Elderly Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression \n\n Janssen conducted a separate Phase 3 study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression. Elderly populations with major depressive disorder are historically hard to treat and often have co-morbidities and long-standing depression. To improve tolerability, patients were given a lower starting dose (28 mg) of esketamine nasal spray (flexibly dosed at 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nAlthough statistical significance for the primary endpoint for the overall patient population studied was narrowly missed, results favored the esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant group (median unbiased estimate of the difference from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -3.6, 95% CI: -7.20, 0.07; one-sided p=0.029). To put this into context, an analysis of placebo-controlled data from three prior studies conducted by Duru and Fantino determined that a minimum change in MADRS of 1.9 was clinically meaningful.2 In addition, the average difference is between 2-3 points for currently approved antidepressants vs. placebo.3\n\nSafety results were consistent with previous studies of esketamine in younger adult populations. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, increased blood pressure, vertigo and dissociation. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events reported in >10% of patients in the placebo group.\n\nEsketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. Adverse events and associated symptoms were seen predominately on the day of dosing and were generally transient and resolved on the day of dosing.\n\nThese findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen's treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray. The results from these studies will inform regulatory filings for esketamine nasal spray in treatment-resistant depression, for which Janssen has received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA. Data from other Phase 3 studies will be presented later in 2018.\n\nIn both Phase 3 studies, esketamine or placebo was provided in disposable nasal spray devices containing 200 \u03bcl of solution (i.e., two sprays), and administered under the supervision of a health care professional. A bittering agent was added to placebo to simulate the taste of esketamine, to help mask the treatment assignment.\n\nThe study in adults with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, active-control, flexibly dosed, multi-center study using blinded raters, conducted at 39 sites in Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Spain and the United States from August 2015 to November 2017. The study enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe, non-psychotic, recurrent or persistent depression, and history of non-response to \u22652 antidepressants in the current episode of depression, with one of them assessed prospectively. Non-responders were randomized (1:1) to flexibly-dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=114) or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=109). The primary efficacy endpoint \u2013 change from baseline to day 28 in MADRS total score \u2013 was assessed among patients who received \u22651 dose of (nasal spray and oral) study medication by mixed-effects model using repeated measures using a one-sided significance level of 0.025. (5.69). For further information about this study, visit the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n\nThe study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled study. Patients \u2265 65 years of age were randomized 1:1 to either esketamine nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=72) or placebo nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=66). The primary endpoint was the change in the MADRS total score from day 1 (baseline) to day 28. Statistical analysis employed mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM), with a weighted combination test to account for an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation, using a one-sided significance level of 0.025. For further information about this study, visit the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n\nAbout Esketamine \n\nEsketamine nasal spray is an investigational compound being studied by Janssen Research & Development, LLC as part of a global development program. Esketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, also known as a glutamate receptor modulator, thought to help restore synaptic connections in brain cells in people with major depressive disorder. It has a novel mechanism of action, meaning it works differently than currently available therapies for depression.\n\nEsketamine received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA in November 2013 for treatment-resistant depression and in August 2016 for the indication of major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide.4\n\nAbout Major Depressive Disorder\n\nMajor depressive disorder affects nearly 300 million people of all ages globally and is the leading cause of disability worldwide.5 Individuals with depression, including major depressive disorder, experience continuous suffering from a serious, biologically based disease which has a significant negative impact on all aspects of life, including quality of life and function.5 Although currently available antidepressants are effective for many patients, about one third of patients do not respond to treatment and are thought to have treatment-resistant depression.6\n\nAbout the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson\n\nAt the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are working to create a world without disease.

symptoms by at least 75 percent in nearly 82 percent of those taking it, compared to just 40 percent of those on methotrexate. But serious side effects were more common among the briakinumab users.\n\n\"Very high levels of response\" were observed and maintained throughout the study period, said lead researcher Dr. Kristian Reich, a professor of dermatology at the University of Gottingen and a managing partner at Dermatologikum Hamburg, both in Germany.\n\nResults of the study are published in the Oct. 27 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug's manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories.\n\nPsoriasis affects about 5 million Americans, according to the U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). The disease causes patches of thick, red, inflamed skin that have silvery scales. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, including the skin, nails, genitals and inside the mouth, according to NIAMS.\n\nThe current study included 317 people with moderate to severe psoriasis. The study volunteers had had psoriasis for at least six months, and the condition affected at least 10 percent of their bodies.\n\nNearly half of the study participants were randomly selected to receive injections of briakinumab at a dose of 200 milligrams (mg) for the first and fourth week of the study, and 100 mg at week eight and every four weeks thereafter. The study lasted one year. The remaining volunteers were given between 5 mg and 25 mg of oral methotrexate weekly.\n\nAfter six months, nearly 82 percent of those in the briakinumab group had at least a 75 percent improvement in the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI), a commonly used measurement to assess the severity of psoriasis. Slightly less than 40 percent of those on methotrexate had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score, according to the study.\n\nAfter a year, about 66 percent of those taking briakinumab had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score compared to almost 24 percent for those on methotrexate, according to the study.\n\nBriakinumab works by dampening the immune system response that causes psoriasis, said Bruce Bebo, director of research and medical programs for the National Psoriasis Foundation, based in Portland, Ore.\n\nMore serious infections were seen in people taking briakinumab (2.6 percent) vs. those taking methotrexate (1.8 percent).

They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism.\n\nMany products in the supplement business are launched with questionable science, but Elysium said studies in mice show a clear connection between increased levels of this compound, called NAD, and improved health in older mice.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of new findings in the past five years identifying some extremely promising compounds that promote wellness and health. [We want to] make them available for people to improve their health before they get sick,\u201d said Guarente, an Elysium Health founder and its chief scientific officer. \u201cWe are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.\u201d\n\nThe active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. Both substances are available individually as dietary supplements.\n\nAt a recommended dose of two gel caps daily, a month\u2019s supply of Basis will cost $60 ($50 with a membership) and will be available online only. The company\u2019s chief executive is Eric Marcotulli, previously a partner at the Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital.\n\nAmong the scientific heavyweights advising Elysium Health are Martin Karplus, emeritus professor of chemistry at Harvard and a 2013 Nobel Laureate; Tom Sudhof, a Stanford School of Medicine professor who received a Nobel in 2013; Eric Kandel, a biochemist and biophysicist at Columbia University and a 2000 Nobel Laureate; Aaron Ciechanover, distinguished research professor at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and a 2004 Nobel recipient; and Jack Szostak, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who received a Nobel in 2009.\n\nSzostak said his role at Elysium Health is to scour scientific literature for new natural compounds that are shown to improve health and bring them to the company\u2019s attention as potential ingredients in new products.\n\n\u201cWhat interests me in this is that it is a different challenge, to apply what we are learning through basic research, not just to curing disease but to keeping people healthy,\u201d said Szostak, who runs a research lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cIf you go to Whole Foods or CVS, you see miles of dietary supplements and vitamins. Most of them have no scientific basis, and you don\u2019t know what you are getting.\u201d\n\nGuarente was involved in several other efforts to develop antiaging medicines that did not pan out. He was a founder of Elixir Pharmaceuticals and then became involved with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which conducted research into the potential antiaging properties of a chemical found in red wine.\n\nWith Elysium, Guarente and his colleagues are entering an industry with a mixed reputation. At $25 billion annually and growing, vitamins and supplements are hugely popular among consumers. But the business has often been criticized by mainstream medicine for making ambitious claims about quick cures and miraculous health improvements that are not subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny.\n\nIf Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine.\n\nBut as a supplement, Basis and similar products only have to be shown to be safe for humans to take, with labels that are not misleading. With Basis, for example, there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice.\n\nIndeed, one scientist not involved with Elysium questions the company\u2019s marketing pitch, saying there is too little information to know what Basis can do.\n\n\u201cIt is not quite clear to me what they want to target with this pill,\u201d said Pere Puigserver, a biology professor at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWhat does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body?

It consists mainly of cells that line the walls of capillaries in the brain and are so tightly packed that many molecules in the bloodstream cannot slip out between cells to reach the brain tissue itself. But certain drugs, like mannitol, will temporarily open the barrier and were first used more than 20 years ago to help other medicines reach the brain.\n\nThe new technique refines the art of opening the barrier: it uses microcatheters \u2014 fine, highly flexible tubes that are inserted into an artery in the groin and then threaded up into tiny blood vessels nearly anywhere in the brain \u2014 to spray chemotherapy directly onto tumors or areas from which they have been removed. The catheters are normally used to deliver clot-dissolving drugs to the brain to treat strokes.\n\n\u201cThis will substantially alter the way that chemotherapy is given in the future,\u201d said Dr. John Boockvar, the brain surgeon who devised the trial. \u201cBut we have to prove that at certain doses, nobody gets hurt.\u201d\n\nReferring to glioblastoma patients, Dr. Riina said, \u201cEveryone is looking for something to do for these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if you buy someone just a year, that could be a wedding or a graduation,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou never know what might happen in the year they hold onto.\u201d\n\nThe study, which began in August, is still in its earliest phase, meaning its main goal is to measure safety, not efficacy \u2014 to find out if it is safe to spray Avastin directly into brain arteries and at what dose. Nonetheless, the doctors were pleased when M.R.I. scans of the first few patients showed that the treatment seemed to erase any sign of recurring glioblastomas. But how long the effect will last remains to be seen.\n\nDespite a beautiful scan, the first patient who was treated died in October, from pneumonia and the spread of glioblastoma to his brainstem.\n\nInnovations are desperately needed to make headway against glioblastoma, which is \u201cone of the most deadly tumors that exist in humans,\u201d said Dr. Russell Lonser, chairman of surgical neurology at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThis is a very good start,\u201d Dr. Lonser said. \u201cThe early data is very interesting and exciting.\u201d\n\nThe complexity of a study like this goes beyond the science. Clinical trials are also a complicated pact, emotionally and ethically, between desperate patients and doctors who must balance their ambition as researchers against their duty as clinicians, and must walk a fine line between offering too much hope and not enough.\n\n\u201cI tell patients, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to cure your disease, but so far glioblastoma is an incurable disease,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Boockvar said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d Mr. Sugrue said one morning in September, after scheduling a second brain operation. But he had tears in his eyes.\n\nThere are about 10,000 new cases of glioblastoma a year in the United States, mostly in people over 45. The tumors are notorious for growing back like weeds even after being cut out and blasted with chemotherapy and radiation, and they are nearly always fatal. With the best treatment, the median survival time is about 15 months.\n\nBut in the last five years, the number of patients who survive 2 years has increased to 25 percent, from 8 percent, largely because doctors began using a chemotherapy pill called temozolomide, or Temodar, along with radiation (Temodar is believed to seep through the blood-brain barrier).\n\nDr. Boockvar said he thought that if he could just keep patients alive for two years, more advances might come along and give them time.\n\n\u201cThe glioblastoma population is very studyable, unfortunately, because the prognosis is so grim,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients often wind up on the front lines of research, figuring they have little to lose and hoping they will be lucky enough to test the big breakthrough. More than 500 studies for people with glioblastoma are listed on the government Web site www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nMr. Sugrue, who lives in Stamford, Conn., with his wife, Donna, and their children Molly and Tim, began having headaches in April. He thought he had a sinus problem. But a scan found a brain tumor nearly the size of a golf ball. A local doctor referred him to Dr. Boockvar. He had the standard treatment: surgery, temozolomide pills and six weeks of radiation, which ended on June 25.\n\nBy July, an ominous bright spot on his M.R.I. scan suggested that the tumor might already be growing back. He continued chemotherapy, but the spot kept enlarging.\n\nBy mid-September, the Sugrues were back in Dr. Boockvar\u2019s office to plan their next step. Stubbly hair was growing in on Mr. Sugrue\u2019s scalp, except for a bare patch, around an arcing scar above his right ear. His eyes, bright blue with thick, dark lashes that gave him a boyish look, searched the doctor\u2019s face.\n\nThe headaches had returned. New scans, displayed on a computer screen, showed signs of brain swelling and bright spots that should not have been there. Dr. Boockvar recommended more surgery and then chemotherapy with Avastin, which had recently been approved for recurring glioblastoma.\n\nIt was approved for intravenous use \u2014 to be dripped into a vein, usually in the arm \u2014 but he said Mr. Sugrue would be an ideal candidate for his study, in which the drug would be infused directly into an artery in the brain, producing levels at least 50 times what the intravenous route could achieve.

Just show me what you want to do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDr. Riina said, \u201cTechnically, I can go anywhere in your brain.\u201d\n\nHe said microcatheter technology had advanced \u201clight-years\u201d in the last decade and was just waiting for a new drug to come along for glioblastoma.\n\nThey wrote up a plan to test what they called \u201csuperselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion\u201d of Avastin in 30 patients with glioblastomas that had recurred after standard treatment. Each patient would receive just one treatment directed into the brain, followed weeks later by a series of intravenous treatments with Avastin.\n\nTheir study involves a technique first developed about 30 years ago, which uses mannitol to open the blood-brain barrier temporarily to get chemotherapy into the brain. Mannitol pulls water out of the tightly packed cells lining the capillaries so that they shrink and pull away from one another, opening up gaps through which drug molecules can pass into the brain.\n\nThe technique was developed by Dr. Edward A. Neuwelt, a neurosurgeon at Oregon Health Sciences University and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Portland. Its best results have been in people with a rare type of brain tumor called a primary central nervous system lymphoma. But it has not been helpful with glioblastoma, because until recently there was no chemotherapy to infuse that would have much effect on those tumors.\n\nDr. Neuwelt said that Avastin had helped to renew interest in opening the blood-brain barrier but that researchers disagreed about whether the drug would lend itself to that use.\n\nAvastin starves tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels, which they need to survive. Dr. Boockvar said microcatheters should increase the odds of success by delivering a high dose of the drug directly to where it was needed most. Earlier research with other drugs used larger catheters inserted into the carotid arteries, which feed the entire brain \u2014 meaning that the tumor did not receive the most concentrated dose and that healthy brain tissue was exposed to the toxic drugs.\n\nBy mid-November, the researchers had treated five patients, including Mr. Sugrue; they first infused mannitol, waited five minutes and then sprayed in the Avastin. In all the patients\u2019 M.R.I. scans, the telltale bright spots that marked tumor growth faded away after the treatment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it means,\u201d Dr. Boockvar said. \u201cNobody knows.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the death of the first patient was a reminder that glioblastoma can invade other parts of the brain and the spinal fluid and that the highly localized spray of Avastin might miss deadly seeds of cancer.\n\nBut Dr. Boockvar remained hopeful for the remaining patients, describing the scans as \u201castronomically far better than I had anticipated.\u201d\n\nMr. Sugrue was still in the hospital in late September when Dr. Boockvar burst into his room and got him out of bed to look at his own before-and-after scans.\n\n\u201cHe took me to this room with all these computers and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to show you this,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sugrue recalled. \u201cThis M.R.I. was a thing of beauty.

Doctors typically gauge such illnesses based on self-reported symptoms and behavior.\n\nNow, a new study shows that a kind of brain scan called functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) - which shows how brain regions interact - can reliably detect fundamental differences in how individual brains are wired. As such, the technique potentially could be used to distinguish healthy people from people with brain diseases or disorders, and provide insight into variations in cognitive ability and personality traits.\n\nThe findings are published April 18 in Neuron.\n\n\"This is a step toward realizing the clinical promise of functional connectivity MRI,\" said senior author Steven Petersen, PhD, the James S. McDonnell Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in Neurology and a professor of neurosurgery, of biomedical engineering, of psychological and brain sciences, and of radiology. \"Before we can develop diagnostic tests based on fcMRI, we need to know what it is actually measuring. We show here that it's not measuring what you're thinking, but how your brain is organized. That opens the door to an entire new field of clinical testing.\"\n\nPetersen, postdoctoral researcher and first author Caterina Gratton, PhD, and colleagues analyzed a set of data collected by the Midnight Scan Club, a group of Washington University scientists who took turns undergoing myriad scans in an MRI machine late at night, when the demand for such machines and, consequently, the usage fees tend to be low.\n\nThe researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people, collected in 10 separate one-hour sessions for each person. During the scans, each person performed tasks related to vision, memory, reading or motor skills, or rested quietly.\n\nFunctional MRI scans generate a dynamic map of the outer surface of the brain, showing changing hot spots of activity over time. To create a functional connectivity map, Gratton divided the brain's surface into 333 regions and identified areas that became active and inactive in unison. She then constructed brain network maps for each individual, showing patterns of correlation between parts of the brain.\n\nThe sheer quantity of data available on each person allowed her to analyze how much an individual's brain networks changed from day to day and with different mental tasks.\n\nThe answer? Not much.\n\n\"Brain networks captured by fcMRI are really about the individual,\" Gratton said. \"Whether someone's watching a movie or thinking about her breakfast or moving her hands makes only a small difference. You can still identify that individual by her brain networks with a glance.\"\n\nThe consistency of the fcMRI scans makes them a promising diagnostic tool. Although the technique's potential to identify brain disorders and diseases was noted years ago, fcMRI-based diagnostic tests have yet to make their way into doctors' offices. Progress has been stymied by confusion over whether the scans reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain, or if they change with every passing thought.\n\nFurther, the researchers found that the technique was powerful enough to distinguish people who were extraordinarily alike. All of the scanned brains belonged to young, healthy scientists and doctors.\n\n\"We need more data before we can know what is normal variation in the population at large,\" Gratton said. \"But the individual differences were really easy to pick up, even in a population that is really very similar. It's exciting to think that these individual differences may be related to personality, cognitive ability, or psychiatric or neurological disease.

I can't do this.' \"\n\nAbby and Davis, like an estimated 5 percent to 20 percent of the population, have struggled with dyslexia, a condition that, broadly speaking, hinders a person's ability to interpret language.\n\nScientists have recently made headway in understanding what's going on in the brain of a person with dyslexia, which has not been well understood. New research suggests it may be possible to tell from a brain scan whether a dyslexic child's reading ability will improve over a few years. It goes along with the general trend of personalized medicine, in which genetic tests, brain scans and other tests can increasingly help predict the conditions for which a particular individual is at risk.\n\nAnd a separate recent study found that some dyslexics may have a heightened understanding of space, despite an impairment in language.\n\nIn dyslexia, also called developmental reading disorder, the brain doesn't properly recognize or process symbols. Children with this condition may find reading comprehension difficult because they don't connect sounds with letters and can't recognize words well. Celebrities including Whoopi Goldberg, Cher and Henry Winkler (the \"Fonz\") have made their dyslexia publicly known, and great artists such as Pablo Picasso are said to have had it.\n\nSome children with the disorder can \"compensate,\" or read fairly normally, but perhaps more slowly than their peers, by adulthood. It is hard to know who will be able to improve reading skills over time, and how much extra help is necessary.\n\nA study led by Fumiko Hoeft, psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine, used brain imaging to answer this question. Her study followed 25 children with dyslexia and 20 children without dyslexia over a 2\u00bd-year period.\n\nThe researchers found greater activation and connectivity in the brain's right hemisphere among dyslexic children who showed greater improvement in reading after the 2\u00bd years. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study this phenomenon.\n\nIn general, much of the language comprehension and processing that goes on in the brain happens in the left hemisphere, but there is some right hemisphere involvement also. Hoeft's study suggests that people with dyslexia who go on to read fairly normally are using a part of the right hemisphere in reading tasks more than the average person would.\n\nIf made widely available, this kind of brain scan could be an important complement to the assessments -- based on reading and behavior -- already available for diagnosing dyslexia, Hoeft said. As this usage of fMRI becomes more useful and commonplace, the high cost per scan would go down, she said.\n\nRebecca Branstetter, psychologist who blogs at Notes from the School Psychologist, says this dyslexia brain scan could provide useful information, but it doesn't highlight environmental factors -- such as the quality of instruction in the child's classroom -- that could contribute to reading problems.\n\nAbby's father, Edward Schwartz, fears that this tool would just add to a child's anxiety about the testing process. The potential to alarm a child isn't worth it, and he doesn't trust that this method would offer definitive information.\n\n\"The kids (are) much more likely to feel like they're broken in some way,\" Schwartz said. Abby, he recalls, \"didn't like it to be referred to as a 'learning disability.' She was happy when people offered her alternative ways to think about it.\"\n\nGuillermo Tilley, the father of 7-year-old Nate, who has dyslexia, similarly would not want his son to have the fMRI.\n\n\"It would taint my interpretation of who Nate is and his struggle with dyslexia,\" Tilley said.\n\nOf course, the results of the study are only preliminary. Participants included 25 children with dyslexia and 20 children without dyslexia, which is too small a sample size to prove anything, although still respectable when it comes to neuroimaging studies. Another important limitation in the study is that some children in the study did receive tutoring or reading interventions, to which they were not randomly assigned. A larger trial that controlled for remediations would offer more conclusive results. But this one found that receiving a remediation did not appear to affect improvement in reading abilities.\n\nHere's another insight about dyslexia: men with the condition may have enhanced visual-spatial abilities, according to a study in the journal Learning and Individual Differences. This was another small study -- 20 dyslexic volunteers and 21 participants without the condition -- testing how people identify shapes, navigate a virtual environment, and do other tasks involving spatial reasoning.\n\nDavis, a noted architect and writer in the Los Angeles area, believes he fits that category. He gets thrown off by pure mathematics, but he's good at anything involving spatial relationships and design.\n\nAnd those kinds of skills should be taken advantage of in school, said Wendy Weiner, principal of the arts-focused Conservatory Prep in Davie, Florida, and mother of a dyslexic child.\n\n\"If they can create projects -- instead of drawing a picture of a room, if they can make a model of a room -- they will generally do it pretty much to scale because they can visualize things very clearly,\" she said.\n\nBecause of this, Weiner said, three-dimensional letters and numbers, perhaps made out of plastic or clay, help a dyslexic child grasp the shapes better. Holding a \"7\" upright in your hand, you're less likely to view it sideways as a \"V,\" she said.\n\nThe most important intervention is a direct, explicit teaching of phonics, or how symbols correspond with sounds, Branstetter said. The sooner it can be detected, the better. A child's personality can also factor in: Some persist despite frustration better than others. Parents should speak to their school psychologists about the best plan of action, she said.\n\nFor Abby, a breakthrough moment came at age 9: She started reading voraciously, and today reads well above the seventh-grade level. She'd had good tutors and plenty of support from her parents, but it also took self-confidence for her to make herself read on her own, she said.\n\nAs for Davis, he'd never heard of dyslexia until a friend brought it up when he was 34, and then went through training at a learning development center. Using computers for writing has helped him tremendously -- especially spell-check.\n\n\"I know a lot of people who have trouble reading, as I did when I was a kid, are dyslexic,\" he said. \"It is an issue that certainly holds back a lot of kids, because of their inability to do certain things.\"", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence? ", "explanation": "\n\n\n\nThis story fails to point out that the \u201cchildren\u201d studied were not beginning readers, but teenagers who were already identified as having dyslexia and may have been involved in special reading programs for many years. It also fails to mention several of the caveats and limitations that the researchers noted in their journal article, including the possibility that misclassification of the participants based on their initial testing could affect the results. In other words, rather than actually improving during the study, it is possible some of the teens were actually better readers from the beginning, but just scored low on the baseline tests.\nNevertheless, we rate the story as satisfactory because it appropriately describes this study as helping researchers to understand the disease, rather than evaluating the clinical usefulness of brain scans. Also, one paragraph deep in the story highlights the preliminary nature of the research; specifically that the study included only 25 participants with dyslexia, \u201cwhich is too small a sample size to prove anything.\u201d It also notes that the study did not look at whether different varieties or reading instruction or other interventions might have had some effect and it includes a comment from an independent expert about the lack of data on instruction or other factors that could influence reading ability.

The treatment, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is covered by Medicare in five states, but few private insurers pay for it routinely.\n\nWhile rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. The technique has been shown to work better than a placebo, but the proportion of patients who show complete relief ranges widely, from as few as 10 percent to as many as 57 percent, according to various studies.\n\nThe debate has huge implications, not just for many of the 14 million Americans who suffer from major depression every year but also for businesses eyeing a potentially lucrative market and insurers weighing whether to cover it.\n\nAbout half of those 14 million Americans seek relief through psychotherapy and prescription drug treatment, according to an evaluation by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But studies show that antidepressants provide complete cessation of symptoms only about a third of the time. Magnetic stimulation is aimed at patients with such \u201ctreatment-resistant depression.\u201d\n\nSupporters say rTMS is worth the cost \u2014 between $6,000 and $12,000 for the four-to-six-week treatment \u2014 because it enables people such as Curtis to resume productive lives.\n\nSkeptics question the price tag in light of uncertain benefits.\n\n\u201cThe majority of studies that evaluated rTMS failed to find evidence of an enduring treatment effect after the initial response . . . and some . . . failed to find any significant treatment effect,\u201d concluded Health Plan of Nevada, a UnitedHealthcare insurer, which rejected coverage in March.\n\nWith the nation\u2019s health-care spending expected to top $2.7 trillion this year, the battle over paying for rTMS demonstrates why it is so difficult to rein in health-care costs. New technology is generally allowed into the market after studies show it is reasonably safe and more effective than placebos. But that\u2019s not the same as showing it works better than current approaches.\n\nExperts differ over whether it\u2019s smart to cover new techniques if they haven\u2019t proved superior to established methods. And they can also disagree over the medical research itself: Was a study done well? Were there enough patients enrolled? Did it ask the right questions? Insurers often call for more research, while doctors and patients \u2014 many desperate for help \u2014 warn against delay. And costs are rarely discussed publicly.\n\n\u2018What did I have to lose?\u2019\n\nIn December, when Curtis first had a magnetic coil placed on her scalp while a $70,000 machine sent pulses into part of her brain, she had already spent a decade trying seven different prescription medications in her battle with depression.\n\nGetting no relief but gaining weight and feeling sluggish and \u201cout of it\u201d because of the drugs\u2019 side effects, she eagerly agreed to the month-long series of five-day-a-week treatments. Most patients have between four and six weeks of near daily sessions.\n\nCurtis\u2019s psychiatrist, Niku Singh, who is also the medical director at TMS NeuroHealth, suggested that she try the procedure. \u201cI was all for it,\u201d said Curtis, whose insurance did not cover the treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of nothing else had worked, so what did I have to lose?\u201d\n\nAs the very first patient treated at the Tysons Corner facility, which opened in December, Curtis paid only $3,000 because the center needed a test patient to meet the requirements of the device manufacturer. The fee is generally about $10,000, but officials say they work with patients who can't afford that. Founders of the center compare rTMS\u2019s potential to that of the now-ubiquitous laser eye clinics; they aim to open a chain of centers nationally that will take walk-ins and accept referrals from physicians. Walk-in patients without a doctor referral would be screened by the center\u2019s medical director to determine if they are in fact appropriate candidates for rTMS treatment.\n\n\u201cWe looked at the Lasik model and said, \u2018Can we do this with depression? Can we do this with TMS?\u2019\u201d said Bill Leonard, president of the company.\n\nDuring a treatment, a patient sits in a chair like one in a dentist\u2019s office while an electromagnetic coil is placed against her head. The machine sends four seconds of magnetic pulses into the brain in 26-second intervals, making a woodpecker-like tapping noise. The whole procedure takes about 40 minutes and is monitored by a technician. Patients say it does not hurt. Studies have shown that side effects are few and generally minor, such as headaches and scalp irritations.\n\nSingh said rTMS works by having the pulses stimulate a region of the brain that helps control mood; researchers say the pulses help depression by activating the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. (Singh, who owns two psychiatry practices in the region, says he does not have an investment interest in TMS NeuroHealth.)\n\nThe use of rTMS for altering mood or affecting the brain has been studied since at least the early 1990s. After reviewing data from a study of 301 patients, the FDA cleared the device in 2008 for the treatment of major depression in adults who had failed to improve after at least one round of drug therapy.\n\nThat study was funded by the device\u2019s manufacturer, Neuronetics, a company based in Malvern, Pa. It found that up to 17 percent of patients treated with the device for six weeks became symptom-free, about twice as many as those treated with a sham rTMS machine.\n\nSubsequent studies have shown a range of results, with about a third of patients reporting complete relief. One 2010 study of 199 \u201cmoderately treatment resistent\u201d patients funded by the National Institute of Mental Health found that rTMS was four times as likely to get patients symptom-free as was a sham procedure. Patients in that study were treated five times a week for three to five weeks. One key measure \u2014 known as the \u201cnumber needed to treat\u201d \u2014 found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. Five percent of the patients in the sham group became symptom-free.\n\nSupporters such as those at TMS NeuroHealth say they are seeing better results than that among their patients, who can continue taking antidepressants along with their treatment. Curtis, for example, still takes a daily antidepressant four months after completing her treatment, but she has been able to sharply reduce the dosage.\n\nCurtis said she noticed no change in her depression at the very start of her rTMS treatment, but she began feeling better after about two weeks of treatment. \u201cI\u2019m not up and down anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nFor patients who don\u2019t respond to prescription drugs and talk therapy, the other major option is electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, in which an electrical current is sent through the brain to deliberately cause a seizure. The procedure, which is more widely used than rTMS, requires two to three treatments a week for three to four weeks and is effective for many patients. But it requires anesthesia and sometimes causes memory loss or confusion. rTMS does not require anesthesia, and its side effects are generally mild. A few small studies have looked at its effects on cognitive function and found either no effect or slight improvement, according to the AHRQ analysis. The costs of ECT \u2014 typically about $3,300 for four weeks of thrice-weekly treatments, according to AHRQ data \u2014 are covered by most private insurers as well as by Medicare and Medicaid. The cost is higher, however, if a patient must be admitted to the hospital.\n\nLinda Carpenter, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, who has conducted medical studies using rTMS for depressed patients, says the treatment is effective for some patients, possibly even better than simply trying another medication. But she says questions remain about how long the effects last and how often a patient should return for additional sessions.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the range of booster treatments people need?\u201d she asks. \u201cIs it once a week, or every couple of years? There\u2019s a huge range in my clinical experience.\u201d Carpenter, a physician, says research has not found any safety issues for patients returning for additional treatments, but cost is a factor.\n\nUncertainty about its long-term effectiveness is why most insurers do not routinely cover rTMS. Medicare also has mainly rejected coverage, though in January, the administrator of the program\u2019s New England region became the first to approve it, citing the AHRQ report and an assessment from an independent regional advisory board.\n\nThat 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression. Six of the 10 said it represented a \u201creasonable\u201d value for its cost; four saw it as a low value. (The same panel voted 9 to 6 that rTMS\u2019s health benefit was equal to that of ECT.) A similar coverage decision proposal is being considered by the Medicare office serving the Washington region.\n\nEven with limited insurance coverage, about 8,000 patients have had the treatment, and the number of treatment centers has doubled to a total of about 400 nationwise since 2010, according to reports by the device\u2019s maker. Centers include some big names, such as Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\n\nStill, some are not convinced. \u201cThe initial treatment with rTMS is $12,000: That\u2019s a lot of generic Prozac or Effexor,\u201d which are cost-effective antidepressants with long track records, said Joel Rubinstein, associate medical director of Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, an insurer that does not cover rTMS. \u201cManaged care has an obligation to a population. You\u2019re shepherding a fixed amount of resources across a large population and trying to do it according to some sort of evidence-based system.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

There\u2019s one issue that the story could have addressed more specifically, but didn\u2019t: the fact that the sham rTMS procedure used in many studies may have been easy to distinguish from the real thing, leading to biased assessments of benefits.\nA couple of other issues:\n\u2013 TMS is evolving (how to give, unilateral vs bilateral, number of treatments, etc) \u2013 so the number of studies for any particular mode of administration is relatively limited\n\u2013 TMS has mostly been compared to sham (which is fine for proof of concept but not really what we want to know); we need more studies comparing TMS to the best available alternatives \u2013 including combination cognitive behavioral therapy + drug therapy (and some evidence suggest drug selection may matter)", "answer": 1, "paragraphs": ["Christine Curtis of Sterling says she is a \u201chappy mom\u201d again, crediting her recovery from debilitating depression to an expensive treatment that sends magnetic pulses into the brain.", "\u201cI can\u2019t put a price on it,\u201d said Curtis, 36, who said she feels better than she has in a decade after completing 30 days of the procedure, called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or rTMS.", "An increasing number of psychiatrists and hospitals \u2014 as well as entrepreneurs opening rTMS centers around the country \u2014 are betting that there are millions of people like Curtis, discouraged by depression treatments that have proved unsuccessful and willing to pony up thousands of dollars for the possibility of relief.

Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. Nearly one in three adults in the U.S. has prehypertension, blood pressure higher than normal but not considered high yet.\n\nThe scans detect levels of calcium in the heart's arteries, and the physicians suggest those people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.\n\nIn the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient.\n\n\"If a health care provider wants to target blood pressure in a patient with traditional heart disease risk factors and above-normal blood pressure, he or she can look at coronary artery calcium to help with tiebreakerlike decisions,\" says J. William McEvoy, M.B.B.Ch., M.H.S., assistant professor of medicine and member of the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"Our study, along with others, such as SPRINT and HOPE, positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target.\"\n\nIn late 2015, the SPRINT trial showed improved outcomes for participants with increased risk for heart disease whose physicians targeted their systolic (the top number) blood pressures to 120 millimeters of mercury, rather than the traditional 140 millimeters of mercury. But not all people deemed \"higher risk\" by traditional methods may need to be aggressively treated, McEvoy says. Some people react poorly to higher doses of blood pressure medicines and experience side effects, such as sexual dysfunction, dizziness, falls, weakness and more. And the risk factor equations that determine whether certain people are at higher risk and should be treated more intensively with blood pressure medications may have inaccuracies on the individual level, says McEvoy. \"We can predict that about 15 out of every 100 people with a particular risk score will die of a heart attack, but the equations don't tell us which of those people will be one of the actual 15; they don't give us personalized information,\" says McEvoy.\n\nConventionally, coronary artery calcium scores have informed physicians' decisions of whether to put a patient on statins, but the researchers say they haven't been evaluated before for their potential ability to determine blood pressure treatment. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Participants were an average of 65 years old, and 48 percent were men. Thirty-five percent were white, 32 percent were African-American, 22 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were Chinese-American. At the beginning of the study, investigators measured their blood pressure and performed a cardiac CT scan to determine coronary artery calcium scores. They also calculated each participant's heart disease risk with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Algorithm, which uses traditional risk factors, such as race, age, sex, cholesterol levels and family history of disease. About once a year for 10 years, an interviewer contacted each participant or a family member to determine heart disease diagnosis, hospitalizations or deaths. After about 10 years, the participants had 642 heart disease events, such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death.\n\nThe researchers divided the participants by their coronary artery calcium scores into one of three groups: those with a score of zero, those with a score of one to 100 and those with a score greater than 100. Then, they looked at the number of heart disease-related events in each calcium score category broken down by blood pressure range and calculated heart disease risk. Low heart disease risk was classified as a less than 15 percent chance of a heart disease event over the next 10 years, and high risk was 15 percent or greater risk of a heart disease event. To get the event rate, the investigators divided the number of events in each category by the amount of people in the study multiplied by the length of time they spent in the study, known as a person-year.\n\nParticipants with calcium scores of zero with a high calculated risk of heart disease had a relatively low actual event rate after the 10-year study. For example, according to the researchers, those with systolic blood pressures below 140 millimeters of mercury and no calcium had an event rate of 12.7 events per 1,000 person-years, and similar people with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 159 millimeters of mercury had an event rate of 13.6 events per 1,000 person-years.\n\nIn contrast, participants with systolic blood pressure under 140 millimeters of mercury -- below the current cutoff for treatment -- and rated with a low predicted risk of heart disease who had a calcium score over 100 had a high actual event rate of 19.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment.\n\nParticipants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores. The researchers say this demonstrates that calcium scores may only be useful in guiding more personalized blood pressure treatment for patients with mild high blood pressure -- the gray zone -- not those with high blood pressure.\n\n\"It may be that if patients are in that blood pressure treatment gray zone with a high risk score but their coronary artery calcium score is zero, then they don't need to be treated aggressively to 120 millimeters of mercury and can be treated to 140 instead,\" says McEvoy. \"But if patients have a high calcium score and are in the gray zone, then it would make sense to go with 120 as a treatment goal.\"\n\nThe researchers caution that results are from an observational study, and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations.\n\nCoronary artery calcium scans aren't usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from $100 to $400. The scans use radiation, so there is a very small cancer risk for susceptible individuals.\n\nAbout 70 million adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure -- a systolic blood pressure over 140 millimeters of mercury -- putting them at increased risk for heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and kidney disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAdditional authors on the study included Seth Martin, Zeina Dardari, Wendy Post, Khurram Nasir and Michael Blaha of Johns Hopkins; Michael Miedema of the Minneapolis Heart Institute; Veit Sandfort of the National Institutes of Health; Joseph Yeboah of Wake Forest Baptist Health; Matthew Budoff of the University of California, Los Angeles; David Goff of the Colorado School of Public Health; and Bruce Psaty of the University of Washington.\n\nThe study was funded by the P.J.

cancers).", "In April, however, the task force proposed instead that men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA\u2019s pros and cons with their doctor and then decide what to do, factoring in that if 1,000 men get regular PSA screening for a decade it will save about one life.", "(Older and younger men are still advised not to have routine screening.)", "The rationale for the re-analysis led by Etzioni is that the PLCO study was a bit of a mess.", "It assigned half of its nearly 77,000 participants, men ages 55 to 74, to have yearly PSA tests and the other half to not do so.", "But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway.", "As a result, when researchers counted deaths in each group, it wasn\u2019t a clean comparison: Rather than comparing screened to unscreened men, they were comparing assigned-to-screening men to not-assigned-to-screening men.", "The finding that assigned-to-screening men were no more likely to avoid death from prostate cancer might therefore have been because their screening behavior wasn\u2019t different enough from the \u201cunscreened\u201d (but in fact partly screened) men\u2019s, not because PSA screening doesn\u2019t save lives.", "In an effort to untangle that possibility, Etzioni and 21 co-authors from 10 countries created multiple mathematical models.", "They all rely on estimates of \u201clead time,\u201d or how much sooner a cancer is detected because of PSA instead of because symptoms are detected.", "The models incorporated the records of all the PLCO men and ignored which group they\u2019d been assigned to.", "Bottom line: Screened men\u2019s cancers were detected earlier than unscreened men\u2019s, and more frequent screening advanced detection more.", "That moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years, Etzioni and her colleagues conclude.", "Researchers not involved in the study weren\u2019t convinced.",

be more health conscious or conscientious, or have other traits associated with longevity.", "If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer.", "Two prominent experts in cancer prevention and statistics agreed, but said they did not want to be publicly identified as criticizing the new analysis because some of its authors are colleagues of theirs.", "Dr. Kenneth Lin of Georgetown University Medical Center, a former staffer at the USPSTF, said crediting PSA tests with reducing prostate cancer mortality by around 30 percent was probably an overstatement, especially since mathematical models are only models.", "An earlier one for the PLCO study concluded that more men died in its screening group than in the don\u2019t-get-screened group.", "\u201cModels are models,\u201d Lin said.", "\u201cNo matter how sophisticated, they shouldn\u2019t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized

who have narrowed carotid arteries in the neck and show no symptoms may be at risk for stroke and not know it, but a simple ultrasound test can identify the problem, a new study suggests.", "This condition, known as asymptomatic carotid stenosis, is caused by plaque build-up in the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the brain.", "This can cause less blood to reach the brain and, in rare cases, may also trigger a stroke if plaque breaks off and becomes lodged in the small vessels in the brain.", "\"Only a small minority of patients with carotid stenosis will suffer a stroke,\" said lead researcher Dr. Raffi Topakian, from the Academic Teaching Hospital Wagner-Jauregg in Linz, Austria.", "The problem is identifying the patients at the highest risk for stroke, he said.", "Most patients with carotid stenosis can be managed with medications such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood pressure-lowering drugs and blood thinners such as aspirin, he added.", "But those at highest risk may need a surgical procedure called an endarterectomy, which clears the carotid arteries of plaque.", "\"We found with two ultrasound methods we could differentiate the patients who are at very low risk of suffering a stroke -- lower than 1 percent per year -- from patients at high risk of stroke -- higher than 8 percent per year,\" Topakian said.", "The patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery, he said.", "Endarterectomy is not recommended for most people with carotid stenosis since the problem can be managed with drugs and there are risks, including stroke, with the procedure, Topakian said.", "Those who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery, Topakian said.", "\"If they are too sick or frail for surgery, it makes no sense to do the ultrasound,\" he said.", "In addition, people at high risk for stroke are also candidates for ultrasound, Topakian said.", "This would include people with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or heart disease, he said.", "\"This test could be a good tool to identify the right patients for surgery,\" Topakian said.", "Of course, anyone with symptomatic carotid stenosis is a candidate for immediate surgery, Topakian said.", "Warning signs include transient ischemic attacks (TIAS), or mini-strokes, which cause no permanent damage but are often followed by a stroke within a few days.", "The report was published in the Aug. 17 online edition of Neurology.", "For the study, a research team led by Topakian followed 435 people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for two years.", "Each participant had an ultrasound to see if there were signs that a stroke might occur.", "These included tiny blood clots, which pass into the brain, and a type of plaque called echolucent plaque, which is fattier than other plaque and linked with an increased risk for stroke.", "Among those in the study, 38 percent had the fattier-than-normal plaque, 17 percent had signs of blood clots and 27 percent had both the fattier plaque and blood clots, the researchers found.", "In addition, over the two years of the study, 10 people had TIAs.", "Moreover, people with the fattier plaque were more than six times more likely to have a stroke than those people without the plaque, and those with the fattier plaque and clots had a risk that was 10 times higher, Topakian's team found.", "Nonetheless, some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery.", "Dr. Lars Marquardt,a professor of surgery at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany and co-author of an accompanying journal editorial, said surgery for people with asymptomatic carotid steno sis is done too frequently.", "Marquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment.", "\"Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis don't get the surgical procedure early enough, and patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have too many surgical interventions,\" Marquardt said.", "When treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis, Marquardt

The low-cost approach, grounded in psychological theories of pain, could help address the nation's epidemic of addictions to opioid painkillers and illicit drugs.\n\nVeterans who received this pain-focused care while also being treated for addiction found that the intensity of their pain decreased, their ability to function increased, and their alcohol use went down, compared to veterans who received a less-focused approach. However, the two groups had similar rates of drug use.\n\nJust 10 weekly sessions of the approach, called ImPAT for Improving Pain during Addiction Treatment, had an effect that lasted up to a year in 55 veterans who took part, according to the new results published in the journal Addiction by a team from the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System's Center for Clinical Management Research and University of Michigan Medical School's Addiction Center.\n\nThe researchers have already launched a follow-up study in a larger group of 480 non-veterans in a residential addiction treatment program.

Ilgen and his colleagues hope their results will help bring the techniques into addiction treatment settings, where the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is often used.\n\nThe ImPAT technique seeks to use integrated approaches both to help patients focus less on their pain and more on other aspects of life. This includes techniques to help people adapt to their pain, find ways to distract themselves from their pain, and think of ways to function in the face of pain.\n\n\"We want to take the focus off pain and put it onto functioning, and finding pleasurable ways to spend time,\" Ilgen says. \"There's also a strong link between depression and pain.

So doctors can potentially pull back the opioids that launched the current drug overdose crisis and still successfully treat pain patients.\n\nNow, by this latest study\u2019s own admission, the evidence is of generally poor quality. Most of the studies reviewed were of poor methodology or sample size, while only a few were of \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d quality. The review also only looked at patients who volunteered to taper off opioids, meaning this research does not prove that involuntarily pulling patients off the drugs will lead to similar outcomes.\n\nSuffice to say, then, a lot more research is necessary before this issue is settled.\n\nBut the new study does offer a glimmer of hope in a fairly grim opioid epidemic: Maybe it is possible to reduce the amount of dangerous opioids that patients are consuming and still alleviate people\u2019s pain.\n\nFor the latest review of the evidence, researchers looked at 67 studies that collectively provided data on more than 12,000 pain patients who were weaned off at least some opioids. Though the researchers found a lot of studies to pool from, they generally graded these studies as \u201cvery low\u201d in quality and methodology.\n\nResearchers then identified the studies \u2014 none of which were graded as \u201cgood\u201d quality \u2014 that evaluated pain-related outcomes for patients after long-term opioid therapy was tapered. Focusing on the \u201cfair-quality\u201d studies, they found that after opioid dose reductions, patients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.\n\nThe authors provide a few possible explanations for this: Perhaps the non-opioid pain treatments, such as physical therapy and meditation, that accompanied dose reductions simply produced better results than the opioids did. Maybe the opioids themselves caused problems that negatively impacted function or quality of life, \u201csuch as constipation, fatigue, poor sleep, and depressed mood.\u201d It\u2019s possible that opioid dose reduction also resolved what\u2019s known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, \u201ca paradoxical response in which patients receiving opioids become more sensitive to painful stimuli.\u201d\n\nOr, the researchers suggested, the observational studies simply showed reverse causation \u2014 \u201cthat is, patients successfully tapered opioids because pain severity decreased.\u201d\n\nThe findings do not mean that doctors can now simply yank patients off opioids and expect them to get better. For one, the reviewed studies generally looked at the results of tapering, when patients are slowly weaned off opioid painkillers \u2014 a process that, Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke told me, can take months or even years.\n\nCrucially, the studies also looked at what happened when these reductions in opioid doses were paired with alternative treatments, including alternative medicines like acupuncture, interdisciplinary pain programs, and medication-assisted treatment for addiction. This is very, very different from a situation in which a patient is taken off opioids and effectively left stranded without any other form of care.\n\nAs the researchers readily admit, the study also had several major limitations. Most of the studies analyzed were of poor quality \u2014 meaning there\u2019s a serious need for better research in this area. And the studies only evaluated voluntary reductions in opioid doses; it\u2019s entirely possible that involuntary reductions in opioid doses would lead to sharply different outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe should be cautious in interpreting the findings,\u201d Joseph Frank, lead author of the study, told me. He emphasized that more research needs to be done to fill \u201cimportant gaps\u201d in our knowledge. He added, \u201cI want patients and their doctors to use caution in applying this.\u201d\n\nA few pain patients will still benefit from opioids\n\nOne of the study\u2019s implications is that opioids actually aren\u2019t a good treatment for chronic pain. This isn\u2019t new. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in its 2016 summary of the research, there are simply no good long-term studies looking at the effects of opioids on long-term pain outcomes, while there are many studies showing that long-term opioid use can lead to bad results in other areas, including addiction and overdose.\n\nThat does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain.\n\nAs addiction and pain experts often tell me, health care can vary vastly from patient to patient. Some patients feel worse on opioids, while others report quick pain relief. Some patients experience grueling withdrawal if taken off opioids, while for others the symptoms are much less severe. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many \u2014 most, in fact \u2014 aren\u2019t. And so on.\n\nIn a few cases, then, opioids will still be the best answer for some individual chronic pain patients. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first.\n\nThis, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn\u2019t be applied to every patient. Like much of health care, each case will typically require individual evaluations to see what works.\n\n\u201cThere are people who do well with tapering [opioids],\u201d Stefan Kertesz, an addiction researcher at the University of Alabama Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told me. \u201cThere are people who do not do well with tapering.\u201d\n\nBut the study suggests that getting some patients off opioids could improve their pain outcomes. The key is convincing patients that this truly can work so they buy into the treatment and genuinely follow through with it \u2014 and making non-opioid treatments for pain accessible enough that patients see them as realistic options.\n\nAlternative pain treatments need to be made more accessible\n\nThe reality, though, is non-opioid pain treatments are often out of reach for many Americans. Patients may not have insurance to cover the treatment. Even if they do have insurance, their health plan might not cover comprehensive pain care. And even if they do have insurance and their health plan covers pain treatments, there may not \u2014 particularly in rural areas \u2014 be a nearby pain clinic or doctor who can actually provide the care these patients are seeking.\n\nThis is something the study\u2019s authors readily acknowledge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important part of this challenge,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThese non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available. Several of the studies were done in pain centers where they have expert programs, and those just are not widespread.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the lack of access to non-opioid strategies may be one big reason that doctors resorted to opioids in the first place. The drugs offered an easy answer \u2014 if ultimately an ineffective one \u2014 to the many problems doctors faced, including patients who had complicated pain problems that physicians didn\u2019t fully understand and tight schedules driven by the current demands of the health care system that made it hard to take the time to work through a patient\u2019s individual problems. (More on all that in my interview with Lembke.)\n\nTo address this, Frank argued that patients need better access to pain treatments. And doctors, especially primary care doctors who are frequently the first people patients see in the health care system, also need to be better trained to deal with chronic pain.\n\nThese solutions could help a lot of people: According to one study from the Institute of Medicine, 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain. The opioid epidemic shows that if this care isn\u2019t made available, patients may end up resorting to drugs that can literally get them killed \u2014 or, as has been reported in other tragic cases, they may kill themselves once the pain grows too bad. (The newest study, however, noted that there is no good research yet looking at these two potential outcomes if pain patients are taken off opioids.)\n\n\u201cNot only do we lack the data, but I have seen and heard of countless cases of overdose and suicide from people who have been involuntarily discontinued,\u201d Kertesz said, emphasizing this is strictly based on anecdotal observations. \u201cOne day in June, in my inbox were 42 deaths.\u201d\n\nThe findings show the balancing act of opioid policy: Even if doctors need to pull back opioids, they must be careful to ensure patients suffering from debilitating pain and other problems can still meet their other care needs.\n\nIt\u2019s not just pain care. When dealing with opioid users who are addicted, doctors and policymakers also need to ensure that addiction treatment is available. Otherwise, these patients will likely try to find another source of drugs \u2014 even if it means resorting to a riskier opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to satisfy their cravings.\n\nThere\u2019s good evidence this happened to many \u2014 but not all \u2014 opioid painkiller users: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found 75 percent of heroin users in treatment started with painkillers, and a 2015 analysis by the CDC found people who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.\n\nThe fundamental problem is many of these patients don\u2019t get addiction treatment once they lose access to painkillers or before they progress to heroin or fentanyl. Without the option of treatment, opioid users\u2019 only answer to averting dependence-induced withdrawal becomes harder drugs. Yet based on a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake. By stopping doctors from unscrupulously prescribing the drugs, governments can potentially stop opioids from flowing to new users who didn\u2019t really need the drugs and could have developed addictions had they been allowed to get painkillers.\n\nBut the reduction has to be paired with increased access to addiction care \u2014 and it frequently hasn\u2019t been.\n\nBeyond addiction treatment, Kertesz argued that policymakers should also address some of the underlying conditions that drive addiction. He emphasized the need for broader mental health care, given that people often have mental health issues that can make addiction more likely.\n\n\u201cWho is at higher risk \u2014 John with PTSD and a dose of 10 milligrams a day, or James, who has no PTSD and is on 200 milligrams a day?\u201d Kertesz said. Based on his reading of the data, \u201cit\u2019s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.\u201d\n\nBut as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients \u2014 showing just another way that the US health care system isn\u2019t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.\n\nAll of this shows why the policy solution to the opioid epidemic isn\u2019t as easy as simply pulling back prescription opioids: To avoid exacerbating existing problems or causing new ones, policymakers need to consider the other needs of people who were perhaps getting opioids they didn\u2019t really need.", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

aren\u2019t a good treatment for chronic pain.", "This isn\u2019t new.", "As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in its 2016 summary of the research, there are simply no good long-term studies looking at the effects of opioids on long-term pain outcomes, while there are many studies showing that long-term opioid use can lead to bad results in other areas, including addiction and overdose.", "That does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain.", "As addiction and pain experts often tell me, health care can vary vastly from patient to patient.", "Some patients feel worse on opioids, while others report quick pain relief.", "Some patients experience grueling withdrawal if taken off opioids, while for others the symptoms are much less severe.", "Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many \u2014 most, in fact \u2014 aren\u2019t.", "And so on.", "In a few cases, then, opioids will still be the best answer for some individual chronic pain patients.", "When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people.", "But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first.", "This, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn\u2019t be applied to every patient.", "Like much of health care, each case will typically require individual evaluations to see what works.", "\u201cThere are people who do well with tapering [opioids],\u201d Stefan Kertesz, an addiction researcher at the University of Alabama Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told me.", "\u201cThere are people who do not do well with tapering.\u201d", "But the study suggests that getting some patients off opioids could improve their pain outcomes.", "The key is convincing patients that this truly can work so they buy into the treatment and genuinely follow through with it \u2014 and making non-opioid treatments for pain accessible enough that patients see them as realistic options.", "Alternative pain treatments need to be made more accessible", "The reality, though, is non-opioid pain treatments are often out of reach for many Americans.", "Patients may not have insurance to cover the treatment.", "Even if they do have insurance, their health plan might not cover comprehensive pain care.", "And even if they do have insurance and their health plan covers pain treatments, there may not \u2014 particularly in rural areas \u2014 be a nearby pain clinic or doctor who can actually provide the care these patients are seeking.", "This is something the study\u2019s authors readily acknowledge.", "\u201cIt\u2019s an important part of this challenge,\u201d Frank said.", "\u201cThese non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available.", "Several of the studies were done in pain centers where they have expert programs, and those just are not widespread.\u201d", "In fact, the lack of access to non-opioid strategies may be one big reason that doctors resorted to opioids in the first place.", "The drugs offered an easy answer \u2014 if ultimately an ineffective one \u2014 to the many problems doctors faced, including patients who had complicated pain problems that physicians didn\u2019t fully understand and tight schedules driven by the current demands of the health care system that made it hard to take the time to work through a patient\u2019s individual problems.", "(More on all that in my interview with Lembke.)", "To address this, Frank argued that patients need better access to pain treatments.", "And doctors, especially primary care doctors who are frequently the first people patients see in the health care system, also need to be better trained to deal with chronic pain.", "These solutions could help a lot of people: According to one study from the Institute of Medicine, 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain.", "The opioid epidemic shows that if this care isn\u2019t made available, patients may end up resorting to drugs that can literally get them killed \u2014 or, as has been reported in other tragic cases, they may kill themselves once the pain grows too bad.", "(The newest study, however, noted that there is no good research yet looking at these two potential outcomes if pain patients are taken off opioids.)", "\u201cNot only do we lack the data, but I have seen and heard of countless cases of overdose and suicide from people who have been involuntarily discontinued,\u201d Kertesz said, emphasizing this is strictly based on anecdotal observations.", "\u201cOne day in June, in my inbox were 42 deaths.\u201d", "The findings show the balancing act of opioid policy: Even if doctors need to pull back opioids, they must be careful to ensure patients suffering from debilitating pain and other problems can still meet their other care needs.", "It\u2019s not just pain care.", "When dealing with opioid users who are addicted, doctors and policymakers also need to ensure that addiction treatment is available.", "Otherwise, these patients will likely try to find another source of drugs \u2014 even if it means resorting to a riskier opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to satisfy their cravings.", "There\u2019s good evidence this happened to many \u2014 but not all \u2014 opioid painkiller users: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found 75 percent of heroin users in treatment started with painkillers, and a 2015 analysis by the CDC found people who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.", "The fundamental problem is many of these patients don\u2019t get addiction treatment once they lose access to painkillers or before they progress to heroin or fentanyl.", "Without the option of treatment, opioid users\u2019 only answer to averting dependence-induced withdrawal becomes harder drugs.", "Yet based on a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment.", "That doesn\u2019t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake.", "By stopping doctors from unscrupulously prescribing the drugs, governments can potentially stop opioids from flowing to new users who didn\u2019t really need the drugs and could have developed addictions had they been allowed to get painkillers.", "But the reduction has to be paired with increased access to addiction care \u2014 and it frequently hasn\u2019t been.", "Beyond addiction treatment, Kertesz argued that policymakers should also address some of the underlying conditions that drive addiction.", "He emphasized the need for broader mental health care, given that people often have mental health issues that can make addiction more likely.", "\u201cWho is at higher risk \u2014 John with PTSD and a dose of 10 milligrams a day, or James, who has no PTSD and is on 200 milligrams a day?\u201d Kertesz said.", "Based on his reading of the data, \u201cit\u2019s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.\u201d", "But as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients \u2014 showing just another way that the US health care system isn\u2019t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.", "All of this shows why the policy solution to the opioid epidemic isn\u2019t as easy as simply pulling back prescription opioids: To avoid exacerbating existing problems or causing new ones, policymakers need to consider the other needs of people who were perhaps getting opioids they didn\u2019t really need."], "annotations": [{"articleId": 99,

improvement in vision,\" said study co-author May Griffith.\n\nCurrently, some cornea patients get transplanted corneas from donors who have died. \"Human donor corneas work very well,\" Griffith said. \"However, there is a shortage of good quality corneas that can be used for transplantation.\"\n\nThe shortage means trouble for many of those whose corneas -- the clear surface at the front of the eye -- have been injured or damaged by illness. An estimated 5 million people in the world have an eye disease called trachoma that affects the cornea, and another 1.5 million to 2 million are thought to have developed cornea-related blindness through other diseases or trauma.\n\nFor more than a century, doctors have considered transplantation of corneal tissue from deceased donors to be the best treatment, the study authors wrote. Artificial corneas are another option, but they're difficult to implant into the eye and can cause side effects, the researchers said.\n\nIn the new study, researchers tested corneal implants that are \"biosynthetic,\" meaning they're created with the help of living tissues. In this case, the corneas are produced with the help of human collagen -- a kind of protein -- that's grown in yeast. The mock corneas were then placed into the eyes of 10 patients after the diseased corneas were removed.\n\n\"We were pleasantly surprised that in six patients, vision improved from about 20/400 to 20/100, meaning that these patients could see objects four times farther away than before the operation,\" said Griffith, director of the Integrative Regenerative Medicine Center at Linkoping University in Sweden.\n\nThe researchers went one step further and gave contact lenses to the patients.

For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.\u2019s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)\n\nOver two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear \u201cwas not superior\u201d to more conservative treatment, the study\u2019s authors wrote.

In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity \u2014 not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more \u201cstable\u201d than the joints that hadn\u2019t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.\n\nBut in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is \u201ccontroversial,\u201d The New England Journal study\u2019s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.\u2019s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren\u2019t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.\n\nWhy, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. \u201cThe reason to have the surgery is to preserve\u201d other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way. Twenty-five percent of those in the physical therapy group eventually tore their meniscuses.\n\nWhat these numbers mean for anyone who tears an A.C.L. or is the parent of a young athlete in that situation is that they should have a long, frank conversation with an orthopedic surgeon and possibly also a nonsurgical sports-medicine specialist about options. \u201cWe recommend surgery based on activity level and sports,\u201d Dr. Dunn says. \u201cMost subjects can do in-line activities\u201d like running or biking \u201cwithout an A.C.L.\u201d He adds, \u201cOn the other hand, we believe that A.C.L.-deficient subjects that do return\u201d to sports involving cutting, pivoting or planting the leg \u201ccan consequently injure the meniscus\u201d or other cartilage in the knee and would benefit from a replacement A.C.L.\n\nThe authors of the study are less sure. \u201cOn the basis of our study results, we\u2019d tell patients\u201d that \u201cthere is no apparent downside of starting a good rehab program and waiting with the surgery decision to see if it is needed or not,\u201d the authors wrote to me.\n\nThe ultimate lesson of The New England Journal study is almost certainly that more science on the subject is needed. \u201cWe definitely know only parts of the long-term outcome\u201d after different A.C.L. treatments, says Dr. Duncan Meuffels, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam and lead author of The British Journal of Sports Medicine study.\n\nBut large-scale, randomized controlled studies, the gold standard of medical research, may be difficult to orchestrate, in part because people with shredded A.C.L.\u2019s can balk at being denied surgery.

Society, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship. Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nVitamin D, known for its role in maintaining bone health, is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation. Previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer. The few randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect; but study size, supplementation duration, and compliance may have contributed to their null findings.\n\n\"To address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin D and to investigate associations in population subgroups, we analyzed participant-level data, collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis, from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies,\" said Stephanie Smith-Warner, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-senior author on the article. The analysis included over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. \"In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,\" explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. \"This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.\"\n\nCompared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations of vitamin D had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years (range: 1 - 25 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined. However, the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 4.2% (1 in 24) in women and 4.5% (1 in 22) in men. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, with about 140,250 new cases and 50,630 deaths expected during 2018.\n\n\"Currently, health agencies do not recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\" said Marji L. McCullough, ScD, American Cancer Society epidemiologist and co-first author of the study. \"This study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin D guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention.\"\n\nVitamin D can be obtained in the diet, particularly from fortified foods, from supplements, and from sun exposure.

For example, might people with higher vitamin D levels differ from those with lower levels in important ways (e.g. diet, exercise, socioeconomic status, etc) that impact cancer risk? If so, the effects attributed to vitamin D might actually be the result of some other factor.", "answer": 1, "paragraphs": ["A new study authored by scientists from the American Cancer Society, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship. Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.", "Vitamin D, known for its role in maintaining bone health, is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation. Previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer. The few randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect; but study size, supplementation duration, and compliance may have contributed to their null findings.", "\"To address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin D and to investigate associations in population subgroups, we analyzed participant-level data, collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis, from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies,\" said Stephanie Smith-Warner, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-senior author on the article. The analysis included over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. \"In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,\" explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. \"This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.\"", "Compared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations of vitamin D had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years (range: 1 - 25 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined. However, the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 4.2% (1 in 24) in women and 4.5% (1 in 22) in men. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, with about 140,250 new cases and 50,630 deaths expected during 2018.", "\"Currently, health agencies do not recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\" said Marji L.

collaborated with many colleagues at the medical school to develop a new approach.", "It combines two methods into one test.", "Their experimental test, dubbed CancerSEEK, focuses on eight major cancers: lung, breast, colon, pancreas, liver, stomach, ovary and esophagus.", "\"We selected those eight cancers based on how frequent they are, also [because] a lot of them do not have any screening modality right now,\" Papadopoulos says.", "The researchers looked at 1,005 people who had been diagnosed with these cancers.", "The blood test found signs of cancer in about 70 percent of them.", "They also looked at 812 people without cancer diagnoses and found just seven of them \u2014 less than 1 percent \u2014 apparently had a false reading that found cancer.", "A low false-positive rate is critical for any test that could be used widely to screen people for cancer.", "Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed.", "And that percentage could well be lower than the 70 percent average.", "For example, the test was successful only about 40 percent of the time in the patients the researchers studied with the earliest stage 1 cancers.", "Though 40 percent success would be far from ideal, \"we still think this is a very important milestone in detecting cancers in asymptomatic people,\" Papadopoulos says.", "\"That could save their life.\"", "\"I am incredibly excited by this new paper,\" says Joshua Schiffman, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah who was not involved in the study.", "\"This is the paper that's going to set the field in motion.\"", "But Schiffman points out that there are many issues to work out \u2013 even assuming the test proves reliable among people who have not been previously diagnosed with cancer.", "For instance, if the success rate is around 40 percent at detecting cancer, that means it misses cancers more often than it finds it.", "\"The thing we worry about quite often is ... if we have a test result that is negative we don't want to give false reassurance to the patient,\" he says.", "He is concerned that patients will think to themselves, \"Even though I have this weird stomach pain that won't go away, I know it's not cancer.", "I'm not going to go to the doctor because the CancerSEEK test told me it was negative,\" Schiffman says.", "\"And that would be a terrible thing.\"", "Another problem is that the test results find signs of cancer, but often fail to pinpoint which part of the body is affected.", "\"That's a tremendous problem that has to be overcome,\" he says.", "\"We've come about one step in a thousand-mile journey,\" says Vinay Prasad, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University who was not involved in the study.", "First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms.", "Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys.", "And for the test to be useful, \"you've got to find cancer that's going to otherwise be lethal, and not cancer that would otherwise be destined to do nothing,\" Prasad says.", "That's been a huge problem with previous cancer screening tests, especially for prostate cancer and breast cancer, and has led to pointless and potentially dangerous treatments, he says.", "An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.", "\"We want this to be true, we hope that this is true, but we have learned through 30, 40, 50 years of cancer screening that we have to do the right studies at the outset to know that it's true,\" Prasad says.", "The scientists at Hopkins have already launched their next study, which could involve tens of thousands of apparently healthy volunteers who are enrolled in the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania.", "Their experience will help answer the next big question, which is whether CancerSEEK will pick up cancer in people who don't have symptoms.", "If that multiyear experiment succeeds, the researchers will still have to demonstrate that the test improves and extends the lives of cancer patients.", "Papadopoulos is less concerned that the test could detect cancers that might not in fact benefit from treatment.", "\"In a personal level, I do want to know,\" he says.", "\"That doesn't mean I have to go and have a surgery.", "However, I still think this is very useful information, knowing that something is happening and follow it up.\"", "As for the cost of the test, Papadopoulos says the research team has tried hard to make it affordable.", "They're hoping to make it economical, so that each test could cost about $500.", "But he says Johns Hopkins holds the patent and has not licensed it as yet to a company that would ultimately set the price."], "annotations": [{"articleId": 120, "sentenceIndex": 11, "annotator": "Simon", "category": "Question 4 test", "rank": 0}, {"articleId": 120, "sentenceIndex": 13,

For example, abemaciclib has greater selectivity for CDK4 compared with palbociclib, which may explain why it does not affect white blood cell counts as severely, allowing it to be taken on a continuous schedule without treatment holidays, he said. Abemaciclib also penetrates the central nervous system, whereas palbociclib does not, raising the possibility that it could be used to treat primary or metastatic brain tumors, he added.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib.

researchers said on Wednesday they had found no evidence that small cuts to salt intake reduce the risk of developing heart disease or dying prematurely.\n\nIn a systematic review published by The Cochrane Library, British scientists found that while cutting salt consumption did appear to lead to slight reductions in blood pressure, that was not translated into lower death or heart disease risk.\n\nThe researchers said they suspected the trials conducted so far were not big enough to show any benefits to heart health, and called for large-scale studies to be carried out soon.\n\n\u201cWith governments setting ever lower targets for salt intake and food manufacturers working to remove it from their products, it\u2019s really important that we do some large research trials to get a full understanding of the benefits and risks of reducing salt intake,\u201d said Rod Taylor of Exeter University, who led the review.\n\nThe Cochrane review attracted sharp criticism from nutrition experts. Francesco Cappuccio, head of the World Health Organization\u2019s collaborating center for nutrition at Warwick University, said it was \u201ca surprisingly poor piece of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis study does not change the priorities outlined worldwide for a population reduction in salt intake to prevent heart attacks and strokes, the greatest killers in the world,\u201d he said in an emailed comment.\n\nSimon Capewell, a professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said the review was \u201cdisappointing and inconclusive\u201d and did not change public health consensus that dietary salt raises blood pressure.\n\nMost experts are agreed that consuming too much salt is not good for you and that cutting salt intake can reduce hypertension in people with normal and high blood pressure.\n\nMany developed nations have government-sanctioned guidelines calling on people to cut their salt or sodium intake for the sake of their longer-term health. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists reducing salt intake among its top 10 \u201cbest buys\u201d for reducing rates of chronic disease.\n\nIn Britain, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Guidance (NICE) has called for an acceleration of the reduction in salt in the general population from a maximum intake of 6 grams(g) a day for adults by 2015 to 3 g by 2025.\n\nU.S. guidelines recommend Americans consume less than 2.3 g of salt daily, or 1.5 g for certain people who are more at risk for high blood pressure or heart disease.\n\nWhile previous trials have found there is a blood pressure benefit from cutting salt, research has yet to show if that translates into better overall heart health in the wider population. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases \u2014 the leading causes of death worldwide.\n\nTaylor said he thought it did not find any evidence of big benefits because the numbers of people studied and the salt intake reductions were relatively small.\n\n\u201cThe people in the trials we analyzed only reduced their salt intake by a moderate amount, so the effect on blood pressure and heart disease was not large,\u201d he said.\n\nFor this review, Taylor\u2019s team found seven studies that together included 6,489 participants. This gave the researchers enough data to be able to start drawing conclusions, they said. But even so, the scientists think they would need to have data from at least 18,000 people before they could expect to identify any clear health benefits.\n\nElaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology in Australia, said that putting a spotlight on single trials and generalizing dietary advice for a single nutrient such as salt was \u201cnot helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is helpful is for the food industry to reformulate products to reduce sodium and increase the nutrient quality of foods by using real ingredients,\u201d she said in an emailed comment.", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Berzofsky, MD, PhD, chief of the Vaccine Branch at the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. \"We are using a vaccine approach to generate an immune response to HER2, which is found at high levels on and drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, colorectal, and gastroesophageal cancers.\n\n\"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine for HER2-overexpressing cancers,\" continued Berzofsky. \"We hope that one day the vaccine will provide a new treatment option for patients with these cancers.\"\n\nThe patients' vaccines are individually customized by Berzofsky and colleagues using their own immune cells isolated from their blood. The blood-derived immune cells are modified in several ways in the laboratory. The final product, which is administered intradermally (between the layers of the skin), comprises patient-derived dendritic cells genetically modified with an adenovirus to produce parts of the HER2 protein.\n\nPreclinical studies, which were previously published in the AACR journal Cancer Research, showed that this type of vaccine could eradicate large, established tumors as well as lung metastases in mice.\n\nIn the dose escalation portion of the phase I clinical trial, patients were injected with the vaccine on weeks 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 after enrollment in the study.

He thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life-threatening urges.\n\nAs a physician-researcher, Halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical treatment in which battery-powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved DBS therapy for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia \u2014 usually in people who haven't responded well to medications.

Yet if offered fattier, tastier chow each day for just an hour, within 10 days the mice realize if they \"don't eat this now, that guy's coming back to take it away,\" Halpern says. So the animals learn to binge.\n\nBut when the researchers applied DBS stimulation to a part of the brain's reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens, the mice quit stuffing themselves.\n\nTrouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system \u2014 one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.\n\nIn 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that. Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area. The RNS system costs around $40,000. But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved. In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.\n\nFirst, they looked for a biomarker \u2014 an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food. Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.\n\nThe intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols \u2014 and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.\n\nThe results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers. \"That's the clear novelty.\"\n\nFiguring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging.

about a newer system \u2014 one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.", "In 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that.", "Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area.", "The RNS system costs around $40,000.", "But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved.", "In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.", "First, they looked for a biomarker \u2014 an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food.", "Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker.", "They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator.", "For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.", "The intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols \u2014 and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video.", "Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction.", "It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.", "The results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers.", "\"That's the clear novelty.\"", "Figuring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging.", "Few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research.", "But Halpern had a rare opportunity.", "One of his patients developed OCD so debilitating that he opted for DBS.", "He agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery.", "Since food isn't allowed in the operating room, the researchers monitored the patient's brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money-making task.", "As reported in the PNAS paper, the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make $5 but not for smaller sums, suggesting some level of specificity.", "Of course, it's hard to conclude much from a single subject.", "But from other research \"we know it's safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens, it's safe to stimulate it electrically, and we expect to be able to tune [the electrode] as we already do with DBS.", "So it seems like a nice opportunity,\" says Halpern, noting that addictive disorders haven't had new therapies for decades.", "\"I'm motivated by the

It\u2019s an emotional decision that women often make quickly, considering that surgeries often take place within days of their cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the women who are on the fence and make a very quick decision before really considering the other options or the fact that it is an irreversible procedure,\u201d said Dr. Todd Tuttle, the U\u2019s chief of surgical oncology and lead author of the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nWhen diagnosed with cancer in her right breast last year, Debra Elmore-Nesheim talked with her new husband and other relatives about the appropriate treatment. But the 43-year-old\u2019s instinct was to have both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cPart of it is emotional,\u201d said Elmore-Nesheim, a pediatric nurse who lives in St. Paul. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do as much as possible to eliminate the cancer, I would feel like I was almost waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d\n\nWomen removing a single cancerous breast have a 1 percent chance per year of suffering cancer in the other breast. That makes removing both breasts a better option for younger women with longer life spans. Many oncologists also recommend it for women with genetic predispositions for breast cancer.\n\nFor other women, a double mastectomy might eliminate another breast cancer, but it won\u2019t stop cancer from resurfacing in vital organs, Tuttle said. He hopes women aren\u2019t making the choice believing it will result in longer life, because the evidence is sketchy at best.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then we have a problem on our hands, because we\u2019re not providing adequate information to our patients,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s happening because of fear or the common reason I hear \u2013 \u2018I just want to be done with it\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a different situation.\u201d\n\nTuttle\u2019s study found 60 percent of women with breast cancer chose lumpectomies, which remove only the tumors, not the whole breasts. Research has found this procedure is equally effective, particularly with smaller tumors and often when used in combination with radiation.\n\nOf the women in Tuttle\u2019s study who received mastectomies in 2003, 11 percent chose to have both breasts removed. That is an increase from 4.2 percent in 1998.\n\nThe rising use of magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is likely contributing to the increase in double mastectomies, said Dr. Joseph Leach, a medical oncologist with Park Nicollet Health Services. Such scans are becoming standard for women who appear to have cancer in one breast, and half the time they raise suspicions about the other breast.\n\nWhile these suspicions rarely end up as cancer, they do often result in follow-up tests such as biopsies and ultrasounds that can frighten patients, Leach said.\n\n\u201cOur own impression is that women in some ways are getting sort of scared into having prophylactic mastectomies because of having these uncertain tests,\u201d Leach said.\n\nBoth Leach and Tuttle are pursuing research studies to address the why question.\n\nWomen choosing to have both breasts removed face higher surgery costs and slightly higher risks of post-surgery complications and infections.\n\nMost women are satisfied after double mastectomies, but a Mayo Clinic survey showed that as many as 10 percent are unsatisfied because of their appearance or medical complications. The survey results came a decade ago, however, when the safety of breast implants was a major issue, said Mayo\u2019s Dr. Lynn Hartmann.\n\nThe safety concerns have been reduced and cosmetic procedures have improved, but some women still probably regret the decision, she said.\n\nHartmann said doctors could take pressure off women by performing lumpectomies first to eliminate their cancer tumors. Then the women can have genetic tests and assess their risks for follow-up cancers before deciding whether to have one or both breasts removed.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve just put some time on the table for them rather than trying to have them make this major decision \u2026 in a brief period of time,\u201d she said.\n\nElmore-Nesheim, the nurse with breast cancer, said cosmetic concerns played a role. She wondered with age what she would look like with an implant on one side and a healthy breast on the other. But mostly, she was scared for her life. Even if removing both breasts only offered a small chance at a longer life, it seemed worthwhile to her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a survival thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting for your life. If it shows up on one side, it could come back, so let\u2019s just eliminate it.\u201d\n\nJeremy Olson can be reached at jolson@pioneerpress.com or 651-228-5583.", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

After that, however, patients taking the placebo had a decline in memory. In contrast, patients taking Souvenaid continued to show improved memory on tests used to assess Alzheimer's patients.\n\nWhether Souvenaid will slow the progression of Alzheimer's isn't known.

During the study, the brains of those taking the drink shifted from patterns of dementia to more normal ones, the researchers found.\n\nSince EEG patterns reflect the activity of synapses, this result suggests that synaptic function increased with treatment, the researchers said.\n\nAn earlier study found that patients with more advanced Alzheimer's did not benefit from Souvenaid, most likely because brains cells had already been lost so new synapses couldn't develop, Wurtman said.\n\nThere are as yet no plans to market Souvenaid, so the cost hasn't been established, company spokesman William Green said.\n\n\"Souvenaid is a test product in development, which is still undergoing clinical trials,\" Green said. \"No plans for the introduction of Souvenaid to the market -- either in Europe or the U.S. -- have been confirmed.

symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats may be no more likely to die prematurely than women who don\u2019t take hormones, a new study suggests.\n\nMany women have been reluctant to use hormones for menopause symptoms since 2002, when the federally funded Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) study linked the treatments containing man-made versions of the female hormones estrogen and progestin to an increased risk of breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe current study, however, looked at longer-term data from the WHI study and found no increased risk of death from all causes, or from cancer or cardiovascular issues in particular, associated with hormone use.\n\n\u201cWomen seeking treatment for distressing hot flashes, night sweats or other menopausal symptoms may find the mortality results reassuring,\u201d said lead study author Dr. JoAnn Manson of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\nWomen go through menopause when they stop menstruating, typically between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.\n\nFor the study, researchers looked at data on 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who joined two WHI trials between 1993 and 1998 and were followed through 2014. One trial tested estrogen alone against a placebo, or dummy pill, while the other trial tested estrogen taken in combination with progestin.\n\nWomen were 63 years old on average when they joined the trials and had already gone through menopause. They took hormones or a placebo for five to seven years and were followed for a total of 18 years altogether.\n\nDeath rates were similar - at about 27 percent - among women who took hormones and women who didn\u2019t, researchers report in JAMA.\n\nYounger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. Over the initial five to seven years when women were randomly assigned to take hormones or a placebo, death rates were about 30 percent lower among women aged 50 to 59 when they took HRT than when they didn\u2019t.\n\nFor women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn\u2019t a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study.\n\nAfter 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women\u2019s age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that the WHI didn\u2019t look at different dosages of hormone pills, and the findings may be different for other dosages or different types of therapy such as gels or creams or skin patches.\n\nStill, the current study should ease concerns raised by earlier results from the WHI trials that an increased risk of breast cancer or heart attacks might translate into higher long-term mortality rates, said Dr. Melissa McNeil, author of an accompanying editorial and a women\u2019s health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTaking a combination of estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but advances in screening and treatment since the WHI started now mean these tumors are unlikely to be fatal, McNeil said by email.\n\nWith additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added.\n\n\u201cHormone therapy has been in and out of favor - first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cThe take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective.\u201d", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?

Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.\n\nHave a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nIs running really a better form of exercise than walking, given that running can lead to more injuries?\n\nAt Vox, I sit near health reporter Sarah Kliff, who trains for half-marathons and triathlons with a casualness most people reserve for grocery shopping. But Sarah\u2019s also suffered with plantar fasciitis and a stress fracture. At times, she's hobbled around in running shoes for months because everything else hurt too much, and even sported a big blue brace on her left leg to help cushion the tiny cracks in the bones of her foot brought on from too much wear and tear.\n\nIn many ways, Sarah is a perfect case study in how to think about the benefits and risks of running versus walking. Running has greater health benefits than walking (Sarah is super fit), but it also carries a much bigger risk of injury (see Sarah\u2019s foot brace).\n\n\n\nSo which effect dominates? To find out, I first searched for \"randomized control trials\" and \"systematic reviews\" on running, walking, and exercise at PubMed health (a free search engine for health research) and in Google Scholar. I wanted to see what the highest-quality evidence \u2014 trials and reviews are the gold standard \u2014 said about the relative risks and benefits of these two forms of exercise.\n\nIt was immediately apparent that running can lead to more injuries, and the risk goes up as running programs get more intense. Studies have found that runners have significantly higher injury rates than walkers (one study found that young men who run or jog had a 25 percent higher risk of injuries than walkers), and that ultramarathoners are at an even greater risk. The main running-related injuries include tibia stress syndrome, Achilles tendon injuries, and plantar fasciitis.\n\nOverall, more than half of people who run will experience some sort of injury from doing so, while the percentage of walkers who will get hurt is around 1 percent. Interestingly, it seems you can walk pretty much endlessly without any increased risk of hurting yourself.\n\nThat running hurts people shouldn't be surprising. As this study described, \"Running produces ground reaction forces that are approximately 2.5 times body weight, while the ground reaction force during walking is in the range of 1.2 times body weight.\" You're also more likely to trip and fall while running than you are during a walk.\n\nJogging even 5 to 10 minutes per day can reduce the risk of death from all causes I also learned about some of the incredible health benefits of going fast: Even five to 10 minutes per day of jogging at around 6 miles per hour can reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and other causes. Joggers have been found to live longer than non-joggers even after adjusting for other factors \u2014 a difference of 3.8 years for men and 4.7 years for women.\n\nThat said, research has found that walking carries significant health benefits, as well. Some studies suggest that you can extend your life and stave off disease by simply walking \u2014 and the more, the better.\n\nAll this research, while illuminating, didn\u2019t offer up any clear conclusions on whether running or walking was better for you overall. So I asked some of the world\u2019s leading researchers in this area. Their conclusion? You need to consider the trade-offs.\n\n\"Running moderately prolongs life more than walking does,\" said Peter Schnohr, a clinical cardiologist who has researched many aspects of exercise and health. The key word there is \"moderately.\" Schnohr warned of the emerging research that doing a lot of endurance exercise over the long term (like triathlon training) can lead to heart problems. Overall, there's a U-shaped association between running and mortality, he said. Too little isn't helpful for health, but too much might be harmful.\n\n\n\n \"The most favorable regimen is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace\"\n\n\"The most favorable [regimen] is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace,\" Schnohr advised. \"Running every day, at a fast speed, more than 4 hours per week is not as favorable.\" And for those who don't like running, he noted, \"Fast walking, not slow, also prolongs life. I can\u2019t tell how much.\"\n\nDutch researcher Luiz Carlos Hespanhol pointed out that in general, running simply delivers health benefits more efficiently than walking does. This study, for example, found that five minutes of running per day is as beneficial as 15 minutes of walking. Hespanhol also said that after one year of training just two hours a week, runners lose weight, reduce their body fat, lower their resting heart rates, and drive down their blood serum triglycerides (fat in the blood). There's even evidence that running can have positive effects on tension, depression, and anger.\n\nEven so, Hespanhol wasn't a total cheerleader for running. A good walking regimen can have similar benefits, he noted. So on running versus walking, it really depends on your values and preferences: \"One could choose walking instead of running as a mode of physical activity based on injury risks, since walking is less risky than running,\" he explained. Or alternatively: \"One could choose running because the health benefits are larger and come faster, in a shorter period of time.\"\n\nTo recap: Running improves your health more efficiently than walking does and has greater health benefits per time invested. But even a small amount of running carries more injury risk than walking. And a lot of running (i.e., ultramarathon training) can well be harmful, while the same is never true for walking.\n\nWhere does this leave us? All the exercise researchers seemed to agree on one thing: that the best exercise routine is the one you'll actually do.

That\u2019s the final recommendation from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) after more than a year of study and lively public comment. The recommendations were published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nAspirin has been used for more than 100 years to ease fever and relieve pain.

The USPSTF recommends it for men and women aged 50 to 59 who are at risk of heart attack or stroke. The dueling recommendations kicked off a lively debate in the medical community.\n\nDespite the clashing opinions, experts agree on two things: Aspirin should be just one part of an overall strategy to prevent heart attack and stroke that includes weight control, healthy eating, exercising, and not smoking. And don\u2019t take aspirin without talking with your doctor.\n\nBeyond that, here\u2019s a sample of expert opinions.\n\nKirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Task force says some will benefit\n\nCharles H. Hennekens: Balance between benefits and harms still hazy\n\nDeepak L. Bhatt: No easy way to identify who will benefit or be harmed\n\nCynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Add personal preferences to the equation\n\nFreek W.A. Verheugt: Even doctors are confused\n\nBy Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Taking aspirin is easy, but deciding whether or not to take aspirin for prevention is complex. Aspirin can help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and colorectal cancer, but it also increases the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force found that the benefits of taking low-dose aspirin daily clearly outweigh the harms for people who are 50 to 59 years old, who have increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and who are not at increased risk for bleeding. People who are 60 to 69 can also benefit from taking aspirin, but the risks for bleeding are higher in this age group. Some older individuals may be less likely to benefit from aspirin\u2019s ability to prevent colorectal cancer because it takes about 10 years of daily aspirin for it to affect this risk.\n\nIt is important to note that this draft recommendation applies to people who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have at least a 10-year life expectancy, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily. Also, it is meant for people who do not already have cardiovascular disease.\n\nKirsten Bibbins-Domingo, MD, is vice-chair of the US Preventive Services Task Force. She is also professor of medicine and of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nBy Charles H. Hennekens: After more than 25 years of research on aspirin for primary prevention, we are not much further along than we were after the landmark findings from the Physicians Health Study in 1988. We know that taking aspirin will prevent a first heart attack and a first stroke, but we also know that aspirin can cause serious bleeding, mainly in the gastrointestinal system and, more rarely, in the brain.\n\nIn a meta-analysis of the six major randomized trials of aspirin for primary prevention, among more than 95,000 participants, serious cardiovascular events occurred in 0.51 percent of participants taking aspirin and 0.57 percent of those not taking aspirin. That corresponds to a 20 percent relative reduction in risk. At the same time, serious bleeding events increased from 0.07 percent among non-aspirin takers to 0.10 percent among those taking aspirin, or a 40 percent relative increase in risk.\n\nAlthough the totality of evidence is incomplete, it appears that aspirin has net benefits when the absolute 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular event is greater than 10 percent. Unfortunately, fewer than 5,000 of the trial participants have been in that risk category. (Individuals can calculate their 10-year risk using a relatively simple calculator from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute or a more complex one from the American Heart Association.)\n\nThese calculators don\u2019t tell the whole story. Clinicians should evaluate additional risks and benefits. For example, some individuals are at higher risk of bleeding, such as those with a history of ulcers. Others are at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event because they are obese, physically inactive, or have a family history of such events.\n\nSeveral ongoing trials will provide information on aspirin\u2019s benefit-to-risk ratio. This information is essential for making rational guidelines for aspirin in primary prevention.\n\nCharles H. Hennekens, MD, is professor of medicine at Florida Atlantic University. He was the principal investigator of the Physician\u2019s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first heart attack in men, and the Women\u2019s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first stroke in women.\n\nBy Deepak L. Bhatt: The use of aspirin for primary prevention is one of the most complex issues in medicine today. That\u2019s ironic because aspirin is ubiquitous and most patients perceive it to be safe and harmless. After all, it is sold over the counter.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The lower an individual\u2019s risk of a future heart attack or ischemic stroke, the less he or she will benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin. Yet the odds that aspirin will cause a problem, such as bleeding, remain relatively steady. That means for some low-risk individuals, taking daily aspirin could do more harm than good.\n\nIf there was a foolproof way to identify individuals at high risk for a future heart attack or stroke, as well as those at high risk for developing complications, we would know who should be taking aspirin for primary prevention and who should not. Unfortunately, no such tool exists.\n\nMany patients \u2014 and many health care providers \u2014 believe that the aspirin-for-primary-prevention issue is settled. Not so. In fact, several clinical trials now underway are looking at this very question. These include the ASCEND, TIPS-3, and ASPREE trials.\n\nThe data on aspirin for preventing colorectal cancer are provocative, but are even less robust than for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.\n\nDeepak L. Bhatt, MD, is executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nBy Cynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Combining guidelines for the use of aspirin to prevent three different conditions \u2014 heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer \u2014 into a single recommendation makes good sense for patients. But making such recommendations is difficult because they must take into account so many factors.\n\nPersonal preferences are one very important factor. Say your mother had a disabling stroke, and you are willing to do everything you can to prevent having a stroke, even if it puts you at risk of bleeding. This might tip the balance in favor of taking aspirin. In contrast, someone who isn\u2019t worried about having a cardiovascular event or developing colorectal cancer might want to stay away from aspirin to avoid bleeding.\n\nWith an international team of colleagues, we created an online tool that calculates whether the benefits of aspirin for primary prevention (preventing heart attack, ischemic stroke, and cancer) are greater than the harms (severe hemorrhagic stroke and severe gastrointestinal bleeds). The tool is based on research we recently published in BMC Medicine.\n\nTo use the tool, an individual enters his or her age group and sex and uses sliders to show how worried he or she is about six outcomes:\n\nGreen, orange, and red boxes represent the benefit-harm balance corresponding to the user\u2019s information.\n\nFor now, this tool is for research purposes only. It must be verified before it is ready for prime time. But it suggests a direction for decision aids that can help individuals choose whether to adopt preventive strategies like aspirin that come with potentially harmful side effects.\n\nCynthia M. Boyd, MD, is associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Milo A. Puhan, MD, is director of the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute and professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Zurich.\n\nBy Freek W.A. Verheugt: Who should take aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or ischemic stroke is a complex issue \u2014 even for cardiologists. A recent report with data on 120 medical practices serving 69,000 patients found huge variation in doctors\u2019 approaches. In some practices, 70 percent of patients were inappropriately taking aspirin. Part of my job, and that of other cardiologists and clinicians, is to help our patients make good choices about aspirin, guiding those at high risk toward aspirin use and those at low risk away from it.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that other therapies, such as statins, have also been proven to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. These are often used in combination with aspirin. As I showed in a commentary in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, when combined with a statin, aspirin\u2019s net benefit in primary prevention is almost completely lost.\n\nFreek W.A.

Shupnik and Kyle Hoehn."], "annotations": []}, {"article": "Among the less convinced is Dr. John H. Glick, director of the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Glick tells his patients about the new data but does not suggest they skip chemotherapy. After all, he notes, the national guidelines were based on results from large randomized clinical trials. And the recent data indicating that some women can skip chemotherapy are based on an after-the-fact analysis of selected clinical trials.\n\n\"We're in an era where evidence-based medicine should govern practice,\" Dr. Glick said.\n\nFor women with breast cancer, of course, the uncertainty is excruciating. Faced with a disease that already causes indecision and anxiety, they are now confronted with incomplete data, differing opinions from different doctors and a choice that can seem almost impossible: Should they give up a taxing treatment when all the answers are not in and they have what may be a fatal disease?\n\n\"If the medical profession is not even close to being of one mind, how is the woman to know?\" said Donald A. Berry, a statistician at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the lead author of a recent paper questioning chemotherapy's benefits in many women.\n\nBarbara Brenner, who has had breast cancer and is executive director of the advocacy group Breast Cancer Action, said, \"There's a real problem,\" and added, \"We finally tell people at the end of the day: 'You're going to get a lot of information. Trust your gut. Nobody has the answers.' \"\n\n\"I'm really glad I was diagnosed 13 years ago,\" Ms. Brenner said, \"when there were fewer choices.\"\n\nDoctors worry, too. It took two years before the National Cancer Institute and its researchers could even agree on a design for the large new American study that will test the idea that many women might safely forgo chemotherapy.\n\nThe study, which starts enrolling patients at the end of this month, will involve women whose cancers are fueled by estrogen and have not spread beyond the breast. They will be randomly assigned to have the standard treatment \u2014 chemotherapy followed by a drug like tamoxifen that starves tumors of estrogen \u2014 or to skip chemotherapy and have treatment only with a drug like tamoxifen.\n\nUnlike the American study, the one now planned in Europe will also include women whose cancer has spread beyond their breasts into nearby lymph nodes. The American study may eventually add such women, said Sheila E. Taube, who directs the cancer diagnosis program at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nDr. Taube said the debate reminded her of one a few decades ago, when the question was whether all women with cancer needed mastectomies or whether many could have a lumpectomy instead. \"To me, the situations are analogous,\" she said.\n\nThe chemotherapy question starts with American and European guidelines that say almost every woman with breast cancer that has gone beyond its earliest stages, when it is confined to the milk duct, should have the treatment. And for good reason, many cancer researchers say: a series of large studies has shown that chemotherapy saves lives and that newer and more aggressive regimens are improvements over older ones.\n\nThat has led doctors to feel most at ease giving very aggressive treatments to almost everyone.\n\n\"Part of it is that this area of medicine we're practicing in is kind of a high wire act,\" said Dr. Michael Lee, an oncologist in private practice in Norfolk, Va. \"It is more comfortable to adopt things that are aggressive.\"\n\nBut most of those studies were done at a time when doctors did not distinguish between the 70 percent of women with breast cancers fueled by estrogen and the 30 percent whose cancers were not.\n\nNow Dr. Berry, the M. D. Anderson statistician, and a group of leading cancer researchers have found that the chemotherapy benefits in those clinical trials were concentrated almost exclusively in women whose cancers were impervious to estrogen. For the others, with estrogen-sensitive tumors, the lifesaving benefit came from hormonal therapy. The results of the analysis, published recently in The Journal of the American Medical Association, were the same even if the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes.\n\nThe drawback of that study, Dr. Glick notes, is that it was not a large prospective randomized clinical trial, the gold standard in medicine.\n\nThere is also another issue. What if some women with estrogen-fed tumors do benefit from chemotherapy? How can they be identified?\n\nOne possibility is new genetic tests, which are part of the two studies that are about to begin. The cancer institute is using the Oncotype DX test, which includes genes associated with response to chemotherapy, among them genes involved with a cell's response to estrogen.\n\nThe study is ethical, said Dr. Larry Norton of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, because the only women whose treatment will be decided at random are those in a kind of gray area, not women for whom chemotherapy would be a clear benefit or clearly unnecessary.\n\n\"I think the clinical trial is really a superb one,\" Dr. Norton said. \"I would like to see it go so we have definitive data.\"\n\nIn the meantime, some physicians, like Dr. Winer, are taking their own best shot at figuring out who really benefits from chemotherapy. He asks how sensitive the tumor is to estrogen, how aggressive a pathologist believes it is, how big it is, how much has spread to the lymph nodes and whether its surface has a type of protein, HER2, that is associated with a better response to chemotherapy. After talking through the decision with his patients, he says, he is comfortable omitting chemotherapy in some who would have had it not long ago.\n\nOthers, like Dr. Francisco J. Esteva of M. D. Anderson, use a computer program to calculate a woman's risks of recurrence and give the option of no chemotherapy only to women with low-risk cancers confined to their breasts.\n\nStill others, like Dr. Glick, are starting to tell women with estrogen-fed cancers that although they still need chemotherapy, they may not need the most intense treatment.\n\nAnd while some, including Dr. Winer, predict that the use of chemotherapy will almost certainly decline in the years ahead, for now most doctors are sticking with the current guidelines, waiting for expert advice from national panels on what to do.\n\n\"I don't know that many doctors who are comfortable giving women an option about chemotherapy,\" said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group. \"A lot of physicians talk about the data, but then they say, 'But, to be on the safe side. ...' \"\n\nStill, doctors say it is not simply that they are urging more and more chemotherapy on patients. In many cases, it is patients who want the most aggressive treatment.\n\n\"A cancer diagnosis is earth-shattering,\" said Dr. Lee, who has had cancer himself. \"You stay up at night. You wonder. Even when you're doing well, you don't know whether to trust it.\"\n\nAnd so, he said, \"a lot of people will take a treatment even if there is a very low statistical chance that they will benefit.\"\n\nThat was what happened a few months ago, when Dr. Esteva told Janice Baty of Sulphur, La., a 40-year-old mother of two, that she might not need chemotherapy. After a long discussion with Ms. Baty and her husband, Dr. Esteva left them so they could decide what to do.\n\n\"My husband said, 'Look, we have two little kids,' \" Ms. Baty recalled. \"I called the doctor back in and said, 'We're doing the chemo.' \"\n\nWomen who say they want the most aggressive treatment may not fully realize what they are asking for, said Mary Peelen, 45, of San Francisco.

The drug also reduced the frequency of disease exacerbations that required treatment with antibiotics.\n\nThe caveat is that VX-770 is designed to counter one specific genetic mutation that accounts for about 4 percent of cases of cystic fibrosis.

People with the disease tend to have very thick mucus in their lungs, which leads to infections and lung damage. Many do not live past age 40.\n\nTwo inhaled antibiotics and one drug that loosens mucus are approved to treat cystic fibrosis, but nothing that directly improves chloride ion transport.\n\n \n\n In the trial, those who received VX-770 gained 10.6 percentage points more on a lung function test after 24 weeks than those getting a placebo, a difference that statistically was highly significant. Patients continued to take either drug or placebo for another 24 weeks and the improvement was sustained. Lung function, the primary endpoint of the trial, was measured by how much a person could exhale in one second, a standard test.\n\nInvestors had been expecting around a 5 percentage point improvement. In a note to clients Tuesday evening, before the results were known, an analyst at ISI Group, Mark Schoenebaum, said that an improvement of 10 percent would be a \u201chome run\u2019\u2019 that could lead to $600 million in annual sales for the drug.\n\nDr. Ramsey, who has received research grants from Vertex, said that some patients could perceive a 10 percentage point change in lung function. She said other results of the trial were encouraging.\n\nThese included fewer exacerbations of the disease in those who got the drug, fewer self-reported respiratory symptoms, and a gain in weight, which is good for people with cystic fibrosis, who often have digestive problems. The saltiness of their sweat \u2014 a measure used to diagnose the disease \u2014 was markedly reduced, suggesting that the drug was having an effect on chloride ion transport.\n\nThe trial involved 161 people age 12 and older, all with at least one copy of the particular mutation, known as G551D. The main side effects, Vertex said, were headache, upper respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, rash and dizziness.\n\nVertex said it hoped to apply in the second half of the year for approval of VX-770 in the United States and Europe. The company is awaiting results of a second trial of the drug, this one in younger children.\n\nVertex has not said how much it will charge for VX-770. But since there are only about 1,200 Americans who are candidates for the drug, the price is likely to be tens of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nVertex, based in Cambridge, Mass., was founded in 1989, coincidentally the same year the cystic fibrosis gene was discovered. It has not yet had a big commercial success and had a $2.5 billion net loss in the last five years.\n\nThe company is hoping that by late May it will win approval to sell a new type of drug for hepatitis C, which analysts expect will be a blockbuster.\n\nThe long time needed to develop a drug for cystic fibrosis is a lesson for those expecting a quick payout from the sequencing of the human genome, which was completed a decade ago. It is not enough to know the gene behind a disease. It can take years of research to determine how a mutation actually causes a disease and then to design a drug that corrects the problem.\n\nVertex received $75 million in financial support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, one of the first nonprofit disease groups to give money to companies.\n\n\u201cThese results are highly encouraging,\u2019\u2019 Robert J.

painful spinal tap for differentiating Parkinson's disease from similar disorders, according to a study published Wednesday in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\nParkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that can cause tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, trouble balancing, problems walking and difficulty coordinating movement. Less obvious symptoms include depression, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.\n\nNeurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are called atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nMany doctors cannot tell whether a patient has Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism.\n\n\"This can be very challenging, especially during the early stages of the diseases and if the responsible doctor is not a neurologist specialized in movement disorders,\" said Dr. Oskar Hansson, lead author of the new study, a neurologist and an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nNon-specialists \"do not really know exactly what questions to ask the patient and the special signs to look for,\" Hansson wrote in an email. Yet patients with atypical disorders \"usually have a much worse prognosis, with faster disease progression, (with) more disabling symptoms\" than Parkinson's patients, so early identification is crucial.\n\nThe correct diagnosis is also key to treatment since \"most patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders do not respond well to dopamine-targeting medications\" that are usually prescribed for Parkinson's patients, Hansson said.\n\nHansson and his colleagues developed a blood test that is, essentially, a variation on an existing test capable of detecting neurofilament light chain protein in spinal fluid. This protein is a component of nerve cells, and when these cells die, it can be detected in both spinal fluid and blood.\n\nBecause spinal fluid is not easily obtained by a primary care doctor, this diagnostic test is not very useful, so Hansson developed a blood test and investigated its accuracy in the new study.\n\nWhen validating a new biomarker for disease, \"one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible,\" said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics.\n\nAll told, a total of 244 people with Parkinson's and 79 healthy volunteers serving as a comparison group participated in Hansson's study, along with 181 patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders.\n\nOf these, 88 patients had multiple system atrophy, which impairs the body's involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.\n\nSeventy patients had progressive supranuclear palsy, which affects movement, walking, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood and thinking.\n\nAnd 23 patients had corticobasal degeneration, which causes decreased movement on one side of the body, muscle rigidity, tremor and a disconnection between thought and action.\n\nTesting these participants, the researchers found that nerve protein levels ranged higher in people with atypical parkinsonism and lower in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the healthy volunteers. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose.\n\nBlood test accuracy is defined based on sensitivity, the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified. In Sweden, the blood test had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91%, while in the United Kingdom, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 90%. For early-stage study participants, generally, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 80%.\n\nOverall, the blood test showed equal accuracy as the spinal fluid test when diagnosing Parkinson's or an atypical parkinsonism disorder, in both early and later stages of disease.\n\nHansson imagines that blood-based tests will be used in the future \"in the diagnostic work-up of patients with parkinsonism by most doctors who are not very specialized with these movement disorders.\" He also believes the test will be used by specialists for Parkinson's patients who \"do not exhibit a very typical symptomatology\" or do not respond as expected to treatment.\n\nThough atypical parkinsonism conditions look very similar to Parkinson's at first, they \"have a different underlying molecular cause,\" according to Bronstein, and so it is important to recognize them early in order to treat them properly. \"Disease-specific therapies are now in trials, so accurate diagnosis is essential in determining if these new treatments work,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases.\n\n\"A lot of time, people come in and say they or a family member has a tremor, and they believe it's Parkinson's disease,\" said Wright, who also was not involved in the study. This early assumption may impede diagnosis of a less recognized atypical parkinsonism condition.\n\nOr a patient has \"horrible blood pressure fluctuations,\" Wright said, and no obvious tremor or rigidity symptoms, so a doctor suspects a heart condition.

is not easily obtained by a primary care doctor, this diagnostic test is not very useful, so Hansson developed a blood test and investigated its accuracy in the new study.", "When validating a new biomarker for disease, \"one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible,\" said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics.", "All told, a total of 244 people with Parkinson's and 79 healthy volunteers serving as a comparison group participated in Hansson's study, along with 181 patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders.", "Of these, 88 patients had multiple system atrophy, which impairs the body's involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.", "Seventy patients had progressive supranuclear palsy, which affects movement, walking, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood and thinking.", "And 23 patients had corticobasal degeneration, which causes decreased movement on one side of the body, muscle rigidity, tremor and a disconnection between thought and action.", "Testing these participants, the researchers found that nerve protein levels ranged higher in people with atypical parkinsonism and lower in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the healthy volunteers.", "However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose.", "Blood test accuracy is defined based on sensitivity, the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified.", "In Sweden, the blood test had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91%, while in the United Kingdom, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 90%.", "For early-stage study participants, generally, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 80%.", "Overall, the blood test showed equal accuracy as the spinal fluid test when diagnosing Parkinson's or an atypical parkinsonism disorder, in both early and later stages of disease.", "Hansson imagines that blood-based tests will be used in the future \"in the diagnostic work-up of patients with parkinsonism by most doctors who are not very specialized with these movement disorders.\"", "He also believes the test will be used by specialists for Parkinson's patients who \"do not exhibit a very typical symptomatology\" or do not respond as expected to treatment.", "Though atypical parkinsonism conditions look very similar to Parkinson's at first, they \"have a different underlying molecular cause,\" according to Bronstein, and so it is important to recognize them early in order to treat them properly.", "\"Disease-specific therapies are now in trials, so accurate diagnosis is essential in determining if these new treatments work,\" he said.", "According to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases.", "\"A lot of time, people come in and say they or a family member has a tremor, and they believe it's Parkinson's disease,\" said Wright, who also was not involved in the study.", "This early assumption may impede diagnosis of a less recognized atypical parkinsonism condition.", "Or a patient has \"horrible blood pressure fluctuations,\" Wright said, and no obvious tremor or rigidity symptoms, so a doctor suspects a heart condition.", "Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease.", "Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.", "An accurate blood test, then, would be good news in these situations.", "\"It's a lot more reassuring to a patient to say 'we're just going to take a blood test to check for a few things,' \" Wright said.", "\"It's much easier and less anxiety-provoking for patients than taking a spinal tap.\"", "Up until now, many diseases have been diagnosed based on symptoms, with patients asking, \"How do you know I have this?\"", "Meanwhile, doctors are not always correct, Wright said.", "This is true even of Parkinson's, which is diagnosed based on symptoms, a patient's history, neurological exams, a patient's response to medicine and, in some cases, brain imaging tests.", "Still, Wright is hopeful and believes a biomarker test for Parkinson's \"will be down the line.", "...", "In general, researchers are looking for biomarkers of disease.\"", "Specialists and sub-specialists are available only in big cities, Wright said, and access to a simple blood test would enable a correct diagnosis in a primary care office.", "\"We always assume there's luxury,\" Wright said.",

omega 3 fatty acid DHA during pregnancy, their babies have fewer cold symptoms and shorter illnesses, new research indicates.\n\nAt 1 month and 3 months of age, about 38 percent of babies exposed to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the womb experienced cold symptoms, compared to about 45 percent of the babies whose mothers were given a placebo supplement while they were pregnant.\n\n\"The data suggested that for most of the symptoms we looked at, duration of symptoms was less when mothers received DHA. And, in the case of colds, the probability of a cold was slightly less. The effects seemed to be strongest early on after birth,\" said study senior author Usha Ramakrishnan, an associate professor in the Hubert Department of Global Health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nRamakrishnan said it's probably too soon to recommend routine use of DHA supplements for pregnant women, because the findings weren't \"dramatic.\" But, she added that the supplements did appear to be safe for pregnant women to take.\n\nResults of the study will be published online on Aug. 1, and are scheduled to appear in the September issue of Pediatrics. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.\n\nOmega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.\n\nTherefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.\n\nMore than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant.

And, at 6 months, the babies whose mothers had DHA had shorter duration of fever, runny nose and breathing problems.\n\nAt times, however, babies in the DHA group experienced longer duration of rashes and vomiting, the study authors noted.\n\nRamakrishnan said that it's likely that DHA boosts infants' immune response.\n\nDr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, \"We've been recommending DHA intake in pregnant women for brain and nervous system development, and this study suggests another good reason to take DHA.\"\n\nWu recommended that women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should \"start prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements about three months before pregnancy and then continue them throughout the pregnancy.

small new study suggests.\n\nThese benefits appear to be the results of meditation's ability to lower blood pressure, stress and anger, all of which have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, researchers say.\n\n\"This is a whole new physiological effect on top of conventional treatment,\" said lead researcher Dr. Robert Schneider, director of the Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention in Fairfield, Iowa. \"People can prevent heart disease reoccurrence using their own mind-body connection. People have this internal self-healing ability.\"\n\nAn outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease.\n\nThe new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. Originally from India, it is not associated with any particular religion or philosophy. It is thought to produce alpha brain waves that occur in deep relaxation. According to the Maharishi Foundation, more than 5 million people worldwide practice this type of meditation.\n\nThe research focused on blacks because they are at a higher risk than whites of having heart attacks and strokes and dying from heart disease, Schneider said. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations.\n\n\"Other studies have been done among whites and the results are similar,\" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the Nov. 13 issue of the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. The study was sponsored by the Maharishi University of Management and funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n\nFor the study, Schneider's team randomly assigned 201 black Americans with heart disease either to a Transcendental Meditation stress-reducing program or health education class about lifestyle modification in diet and exercise.\n\nAlmost 60 percent of the participants were taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Forty-one percent of the meditation group took aspirin, as did 31 percent of the health education group; 38 percent of the meditation group and 43 percent of the health education group smoked, the researchers noted.\n\nParticipants' average body-mass index -- a measurement of body fat based on height and weight -- was 32, which is considered obese.\n\nMeditation consisted of sitting with eyes closed for about 20 minutes twice a day. The goal was to rest while remaining alert.\n\nAfter more than five years of follow-up, the researchers found those who meditated saw significant reductions in blood pressure and anger compared to those receiving health education. In addition, 20 people in the medication group had a heart attack or stroke or died, compared with 32 in the health education group.\n\nBoth groups increased exercise and drank less. For those who meditated, there was a trend toward reduced smoking; however, this was not statistically significant.\n\nLearning how to do Transcendental Meditation isn't inexpensive.

It is produced when enzymes act to convert a precursor molecule, angiotensinogen. Lisinopril is a member of a drug family called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. Other examples of ACE inhibitors are benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec) and ramipril (Altace).\n\nReducing angiotensin production by giving ACE inhibitors can lower blood pressure. The same effect can be achieved with drugs that block the cell receptors through which angiotensin acts. Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. Such drugs include candesartan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan).\n\nIn the study, men taking an angiotensin receptor blocker had a 24 percent lower incidence of dementia than those taking other cardiovascular drugs. The risk was 19 percent lower for men taking ACE inhibitors. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs.\n\nIn men with Alzheimer's disease, use of an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced admission to nursing homes by half.

The enzyme, called collagenase, breaks down collagen, a major component of the body\u2019s connective tissue that is found in skin, tendons, cartilage and other organs.\n\nBut collagenase by itself does not cause gangrene. And there are times doctors need to break down collagen, such as when an excess builds up in the hand or penis, causing Dupuytren\u2019s and Peyronie\u2019s. The ailments are named for French surgeons who described the conditions in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe enzyme was first extracted from the bacteria around 1950 by Ines Mandl, a young biochemist at Columbia University. Edwin H. Wegman, a Long Island entrepreneur, learned about Dr. Mandl\u2019s work and set up a company called Advance Biofactures, which later became BioSpecifics, to turn collagenase into a drug.\n\nIn 1965, the company won approval of an ointment containing collagenase for use in removing dead tissue from skin ulcers and burns. The ointment, sold by licensees under the name Santyl, was a modest success, but the company never truly prospered.\n\nSo in the 1970s the company began developing what it thought would be a bigger money-maker, an injectable collagenase. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. Finally, in the early 1990s, two professors of orthopedics at the nearby State University of New York at Stony Brook suggested using the drug for Dupuytren\u2019s.\n\nThe professors, Dr. Lawrence C. Hurst and Marie A. Badalamente, injected the drug into the tails of rats, as a stand-in for human fingers. They found they could dissolve the collagen in tendons, making the tails floppy, without harming nearby nerves and arteries. Then they organized clinical trials in patients and got federal grants to help pay for the work. The professors and Stony Brook will share a royalty of one half of 1 percent of sales of Xiaflex for use in treating Dupuytren\u2019s.\n\nBut work was slowed by lack of money, and by 2004, BioSpecifics was about out of cash.

It already was selling a gel for men with low testosterone and had learned from urologists about the need for better treatments for bent penises.\n\n\u201cFrom talking with surgeons and patients who have Peyronie\u2019s, neither of them wants to do the surgery,\u201d said Will Sargent, a spokesman for Auxilium.\n\nTwo years ago, the drug giant Pfizer, which sells the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, licensed the European rights to Xiaflex from Auxilium for an initial payment of $75 million. BioSpecifics got $6.4 million of that amount and will receive 8.5 percent of additional payments of up to $410 million that Pfizer might make.\n\nAuxilium sought approval for treating Dupuytren\u2019s first because it was easier to measure success in straightening fingers. But the company hopes to begin late-stage trials of Xiaflex for Peyronie\u2019s disease later this year. In a midstage trial, injections of Xiaflex into the collagen plaque in the penis reduced the curvature. But the drug did not reduce pain or discomfort during intercourse by a statistically significant amount.\n\nWhile collagenase itself is not patented, the companies do have patents on the use of the enzyme to treat Dupuytren\u2019s and Peyronie\u2019s. They are also shielded from competition for seven years under a federal law aimed at spurring development of drugs for rare, or \u201corphan,\u201d diseases \u2014 even though newer estimates suggest these two diseases are not as rare as thought when the drugs were given orphan status.\n\nAuxilium and BioSpecifics hope that the half-century-old collagenase might eventually become as versatile as Botox, another bacterial product. They are looking at uses that range from loosening up immobile \u201cfrozen shoulders\u201d to eliminating fat bulges and cellulite.\n\nWith its belated success, BioSpecifics has sold off its ointment business.

It published the new guidelines today in the Annals of Internal Medicine. \"And on the other side, the risks are large and dramatic.\"\n\nThe task force and other groups concluded previously that it was unclear whether the benefits of the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test outweigh the risks. The new review of the scientific literature found no evidence to alter that assessment for younger men. It did find enough new data to recommend for the first time against screening for older men.\n\n\"We felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75,\" Calonge said.\n\nThe recommendations come at a time when doctors are increasingly questioning whether many tests, drugs and procedures are being overused, unnecessarily driving up health-care costs and exposing patients to the risks of unneeded treatment.\n\n\"There is this idea that more is always better, and if a test is available we should use it,\" said Howard A. Brody, a professor of family medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. \"A lot of times, we're doing more harm than good.\"\n\nThe guidelines address perhaps the most important and contentious issue in men's health, and were praised by officials at several leading medical groups, including the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society. But they drew strong criticism from others who are convinced that routine screening is necessary.\n\n\"I think they're really missing the boat,\" said William J. Catalona, a professor of urology at Northwestern University. \"It's a disservice to patients. A lot of men die from prostate cancer, and there's just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives.\"\n\nEach year, prostate cancer is diagnosed in more than 218,000 U.S. men. About 28,000 die of it, making it the most common cancer and second-leading cancer killer among men.\n\nThe PSA test, which measures a protein in the blood produced by prostate tissue, has significantly increased the number of prostate cancer cases being diagnosed at very early stages. But it remains unclear whether that translates into a reduction in the death rate from the disease. Prostate cancer often grows so slowly that many men die from something else without ever knowing they had it.\n\nBecause it is not clear precisely what PSA level signals the presence of cancer, many men experience stressful false alarms that lead to unnecessary surgical biopsies to make a definitive diagnosis, which can be painful and in rare cases can cause serious complications.\n\nEven when the test picks up a real cancer, doctors are uncertain what, if anything, men should do about it. Many men simply are monitored closely to see if the tumor shows signs of growing or spreading. Others undergo surgery, radiation and hormone treatments, which often leave them incontinent, impotent and experiencing other complications.\n\n\"People say, 'What's the harm in screening?' In fact, there are several ways in which screening can actually be harmful,\" said Howard L. Parnes of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nSince the task force issued its previous recommendations in 2002, at least eight new studies have been published. Among them was a large Swedish review that found that men age 65 and older who were treated for prostate cancer were no more likely to survive than those who were not.\n\n\"If therapy isn't providing meaningful benefit, then how could screening provide benefit?\" Calonge said. \"And we know that the therapy produces significant harms.\"\n\nMen younger than 75 should be carefully counseled about the potential risks associated with the test and the lack of evidence about any benefit before getting it, the panel said.\n\nMen at high risk for prostate cancer, such as African Americans and those with a family history of the disease, are the most likely to benefit from PSA screening. But the panel concluded that the evidence remains inconclusive for those men as well.\n\nSeveral other experts said that the new recommendations strike a careful balance, and that they hope they might discourage large-scale screenings where the risks and benefits are not carefully laid out.\n\n\"I think they are right on target,\" Parnes said.\n\nOthers were highly critical, noting that prostate cancer death rates have plummeted in many countries after they instituted widespread PSA screening.\n\n\"We have seen a dramatic drop in mortality,\" said J. Brantley Thrasher, chairman of the urology department at the University of Kansas and a spokesman for the American Urological Association. \"They're not paying attention to that.\"\n\nOthers objected to setting an age cutoff, saying men should be evaluated individually.\n\n\"Men are living a lot longer and healthier these days.

The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\nThe study, from which headline results were reported in October 2015, showed that the two-dose candidate shingles vaccine had 90% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 84-94%) compared to placebo in people over 70 years old. Vaccine efficacy was maintained across the various age groups included in the study, ranging between 90% in people aged 70-79 years (95% confidence interval: 83-94%) and 89% in those aged 80 years and above1 (95% confidence interval: 74-96%)1.\n\nThe high efficacy is in line with the results of the ZOE-50 trial, a study in people over 50 years old which was presented and published last year showing a 97% efficacy (95% confidence interval: 93-99%)2. A pooled analysis of data from both trials showed the vaccine demonstrated 91% efficacy against shingles (95% confidence interval: 86-95%) in adults aged 70 years and older compared to placebo1. This efficacy was maintained with an 88% reduction in the risk of shingles (95% confidence interval: 73-95%) in the fourth year after vaccination.\n\nThe risk of serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases or deaths observed in ZOE-70 was similar in people receiving Shingrix and placebo. The most commonly reported local adverse reaction was pain at the injection site and the most frequently reported systemic adverse reaction was fatigue. The majority of injection site and systemic reactions occurred within seven days of vaccination, with most lasting 1-3 days, and generally were mild-to-moderate in intensity1.\n\nIn addition, a pooled analysis of data from the ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 trials showed that the candidate vaccine effectively reduced the risk of subsequent chronic neuropathic pain, also known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)1 which is the most common, and often severe, complication of shingles3,4. The candidate vaccine was shown to be 89% (95% confidence interval: 68-97%) efficacious in preventing PHN in people aged 70 years and older and 91% efficacious (95% confidence interval: 75-98%) in people aged 50 years and over1.\n\nDr Emmanuel Hanon, Senior Vice President, Vaccines Research and Development, GSK, said: \"This is the first time that such high efficacy has been demonstrated in a vaccine candidate for older people and it is remarkable, as we know that these people frequently have an age-related weakening of their immune system. If approved, this candidate vaccine could be an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people.\"\n\nAnthony Cunningham, Executive Director of the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Australia and Principal Investigator of the ZOE-70 study said: \"These data show that this investigational vaccine maintains high efficacy against herpes zoster in people over 70 and 80 years of age, the age groups who are most affected by the disease. Importantly, it also prevents a common and feared complication of herpes zoster, prolonged pain, or post herpetic neuralgia in these groups.\"\n\nBased on these and the previously reported ZOE-50 data2, GSK expects to start submitting regulatory applications for the candidate vaccine for the prevention of shingles in people 50 years and above later this year.\n\nAbout Shingrix\n\nShingrix is a non-live, adjuvanted, subunit (HZ/su) candidate vaccine to help prevent herpes zoster and its complications. The candidate vaccine combines glycoprotein E, a protein found on the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that causes shingles, with an adjuvant system, AS01 , which is intended to enhance the immunological response to the antigen5.\n\nAdditional trials to evaluate the ability of Shingrix to help prevent shingles are ongoing in healthy people aged 50 and older and in adults with compromised immune systems. These studies will provide additional information with respect to the efficacy and safety profile of the candidate vaccine as well as its ability to stimulate immune responses in other populations and in specific circumstances.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nThe name Shingrix is not yet approved for use by regulatory authorities in most countries, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n\n\n\nAbout the ZOE-70 trial\n\nThe ZOE-70 (ZOster Efficacy in adults aged 70 years and over) (NCT01165229) study is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution) multicentre, multinational (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific) phase III trial involving more than 14,800 adults aged 70 years and older. Two doses were given intramuscularly two months apart. The study, which started in August 2010 in parallel with the ZOE-50 trial, includes subjects in the age ranges 70-79 and \u226580 years. The primary objective of ZOE-70 is overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people 70 years and over, compared to placebo. The co-primary objectives of the pooled analysis over both studies are the assessment of overall vaccine efficacy in reducing the risk of developing shingles and PHN in people aged 70 years and over, using pooled data from both ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 studies.\n\nAbout the ZOE-50 trial\n\nThe ZOE-50 (ZOster Efficacy in adults aged 50 years and over) (NCT01165177) study is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution) multicentre, multinational (North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific) phase III trial involving 16,160 adults aged 50 years and older. The study started in August 2010. Two doses were given intramuscularly two months apart. The primary objective of this study is the overall vaccine efficacy against shingles in people aged 50 years or older, compared to placebo. The study includes subjects in the age ranges 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and \u226580 years.\n\nAbout the phase III study programme\n\nInvolving more than 37,000 subjects globally, the phase III programme for GSK's candidate shingles vaccine evaluates its efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. In addition to older adults, the candidate vaccine is being evaluated in immunocompromised patient populations, including solid and haematological cancer patients, haematopoietic stem cell and renal transplant recipients and HIV-infected people.\n\n\n\nAbout shingles\n\nShingles typically presents as a painful, itchy rash that develops on one side of the body, as a result of reactivation of latent chickenpox virus (varicella zoster virus, VZV). Anyone who has been infected with VZV is at risk of developing shingles, with age and altered immune system being recognised as the main risk factors3,4. Complications from shingles can include PHN, (the most common complication), scarring, vision complications, secondary infection and nerve palsies3,4.PHN is often defined as a localized pain of significant intensity persisting at least 90 days after the appearance of the acute shingles rash4.\n\nData from many countries indicate that older adults (aged 50 and over) are at highest risk for shingles as more than 90% of older adults have been infected with wild type VZV3. A person's risk for shingles increases sharply after 50 years of age3. Risk of complications, including PHN and hospitalisation, also increase with age3. The individual lifetime risk of developing shingles is approximately one in three for people in the USA; however, for individuals aged 85 and over, this risk increases to one in two people3,4.\n\u2022 Cunningham et al., N Engl J Med 2016; 375: 1019-32.

chronic neuropathic pain, also known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)1 which is the most common, and often severe, complication of shingles3,4.", "The candidate vaccine was shown to be 89% (95% confidence interval: 68-97%) efficacious in preventing PHN in people aged 70 years and older and 91% efficacious (95% confidence interval: 75-98%) in people aged 50 years and over1.", "Dr Emmanuel Hanon, Senior Vice President, Vaccines Research and Development, GSK, said: \"This is the first time that such high efficacy has been demonstrated in a vaccine candidate for older people and it is remarkable, as we know that these people frequently have an age-related weakening of their immune system.", "If approved, this candidate vaccine could be an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people.\"", "Anthony Cunningham, Executive Director of the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Australia and Principal Investigator of the ZOE-70 study said: \"These data show that this investigational vaccine maintains high efficacy against herpes zoster in people over 70 and 80 years of age, the age groups who are most affected by the disease.", "Importantly, it also prevents a common and feared complication of herpes zoster, prolonged pain, or post herpetic neuralgia in these groups.\"", "Based on these and the previously reported ZOE-50 data2, GSK expects to start submitting regulatory applications for the candidate vaccine for the prevention of shingles in people 50 years and above later this year.", "About Shingrix", "Shingrix is a non-live, adjuvanted, subunit (HZ/su) candidate vaccine to help prevent herpes zoster and its complications.", "The candidate vaccine combines glycoprotein E, a protein found on the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that causes shingles, with an adjuvant system, AS01 , which is intended to enhance the immunological response to the antigen5.", "Additional trials to evaluate the ability of Shingrix to help prevent shingles are ongoing in healthy people aged 50 and older and in adults with compromised immune systems.", "These studies will provide additional information with respect to the efficacy and safety profile of the candidate vaccine as well as its ability to stimulate immune responses in other populations and in specific circumstances.", "Notes to editors", "The name Shingrix is not yet approved for use by regulatory authorities in most countries, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).", "About the ZOE-70 trial", "The ZOE-70 (ZOster Efficacy in adults aged 70 years and over) (NCT01165229) study is a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (saline

recognised as the main risk factors3,4.", "Complications from shingles can include PHN, (the most common complication), scarring, vision complications, secondary infection and nerve palsies3,4.PHN is often defined as a localized pain of significant intensity persisting at least 90 days after the appearance of the acute shingles rash4.", "Data from many countries indicate that older adults (aged 50 and over) are at highest risk for shingles as more than 90% of older adults have been infected with wild type VZV3.", "A person's risk for shingles increases sharply after 50 years of age3.", "Risk of

Detailed results from a Phase 2 study of a novel colonoscopy prep (ECP) under development by ColonaryConcepts, LLC show the investigational treatment to be at least as effective and safe as two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations, while offering a much higher level of patient satisfaction and preference than standard preps. The investigational prep is designed to be good-tasting, with no fasting and lower fluid requirements than standard preps.

memory problems.\n\nResearchers report these findings in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry.\n\nThis is the longest clinical follow-up ever of patients who begin with mild cognitive impairment, researchers reported.

Clinical trials can better focus their efforts if patients are known to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Generally, about 30% to 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment show evidence of underlying symptoms of Alzheimer's, so not everyone with this condition is a good candidate for an Alzheimer's trial.\n\nResearchers focused on two biomarkers previously thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease: a kind of protein called beta-amyloid, and another protein type called tau. Experts believe a decrease in beta-amyloid in the fluid of the spinal cord is associated with a toxic buildup of that protein in the brain, which causes the formation of plaques linked to Alzheimer's disease. Tau has been tied to neurofibrillary tangles in the brain; researchers find that an increase in tau in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with Alzheimer's also.\n\nThe results from the study suggest that beta-amyloid is a much earlier predictor of Alzheimer's disease than tau, which supports the hypothesis that beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain occurs first in the course of the disease.\n\nSome of the participants, who were originally found to be stable with mild cognitive impairment after about five years, went on to develop Alzheimer's disease during the longer follow-up.

The rest of us want to know how much we have to exercise to see health benefits. Now we have some answers: You may want to go just a tad longer and harder than you'd thought.\n\nCurrent government guidelines advise adults to get the equivalent of at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of higher-intensity exercise every week, plus some strength training. In effect, those guidelines say there's no particular benefit from working out harder, other than saving time.\n\nTo find out if that's true, researchers at Queen's University in Ontario studied different combinations of exercise intensity and duration in a group of 300 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity. (That's generally defined as a waist circumference of more than 35 inches for women who aren't pregnant and more than 40 inches for men.) People with abdominal obesity are at higher risk of heart disease and early death than people with slimmer waistlines.\n\nAll the exercisers were told to work out under supervision five times per week for 24 weeks. One group worked out at low intensity, about 50 percent of maximum oxygen uptake (VO max, a measure of cardiovascular fitness), for about 31 minutes per session \u2014 enough to burn 180 calories for women and 300 for men. That exercise prescription was about the same as in the government guidelines. The intensity was about equivalent to walking slowly, said study author Robert Ross, a kinesiologist at Queen's University.\n\nAnother group exercised at the same low intensity but almost twice as long \u2014 about 58 minutes on average, or five hours a week, until the women had burned 360 calories and the men 600.\n\nAnd a third group exercised at a higher but still moderate intensity, 75 percent of VO max, until they'd burned the same number of calories as the second group. That took about 40 minutes a day, or 3.3 hours a week. That intensity was equivalent to brisk walking for the previously sedentary participants, Ross told Shots.

They also wore accelerometers to track their physical activity during the rest of the day, to make sure the more intense exercisers weren't compensating with more time on the sofa.\n\nAt the end of the study, members of all three exercise groups lost an average of about 2 inches from their waist circumference. There weren't differences between the three groups. The average exerciser also lost 5 to 6 percent of body weight.\n\n\"The take-home message here is that if you're consuming a healthful diet and engaging with exercise consistent with the guidelines, you're going to see a benefit in your waistline and on the bathroom scale,\" said Ross. The results were published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nBut there was also a benefit from going just a bit faster: Only participants in the higher-intensity group saw an improvement in glucose tolerance, a risk factor for heart disease. (It's unclear whether the 9 percent improvement seen will be enough to cut their risk of heart disease, though.)\n\nThe result makes sense, since there's some previous evidence suggesting that higher-intensity exercise is tied to improving how the body processes sugar, said Neal Pire, an exercise physiologist who puts together medically based training programs at HNH Fitness in Oradell, N.J., a program of Holy Name Medical Center. Strength training can also improve glucose tolerance, which is why it's part of the government guidelines, he told Shots.\n\nCardiovascular fitness also improved in all three groups, but the lower-intensity exercisers who went longer did better than those who went shorter, and the higher-intensity group did better still.\n\nBottom line: All the exercisers improved, but the folks who did the best walked briskly for about 40 minutes five times a week.

In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.\n\nBut what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer?\n\nThe Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.\n\nOther medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.\n\nBut few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. A 2010 study found \u201cexceptionally low\u201d rates of usage.\n\nIn part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women\u2019s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.\n\nThe \u201clow uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,\u201d says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. \u201cMany high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.\u201d On the other hand, these drugs don\u2019t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious \u2014 such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer \u2014 only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that \u201chigh risk\u201d definition\n\nChemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.\n\nAnd they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.\n\nA 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.\n\nInvestigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.\n\nNelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is \u201cconfident\u201d that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.\n\nKenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force\u2019s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they \u201chave not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.\u201d One possible explanation, he says, is that \u201cthese drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.\u201d\n\nNot used enough?\n\nGiven that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.\n\nFor some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman\u2019s chances of having breast cancer in a five-year period and over a lifetime.\n\nBut this is where it gets more complicated. While many experts agree that women at high risk should consider the medications, they do not agree on what Gail score should trigger that consideration.\n\nThe studies that served as the basis for the FDA approval of the drugs, along with recently released guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), set the threshold at a five-year Gail score of 1.67 percent.\n\nThe Preventive Services Task Force, however, recommended a threshold of 3 percent. At that point, the panel said, women \u201care likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene.\u201d\n\nASCO\u2019s lower cutoff worries some experts. \u201cAt the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,\u201d Georgetown\u2019s Lin says, \u201cevery woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.\u201d That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects.\n\nKala Visvanathan, the lead author of the ASCO recommendations and a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the cutoffs provide only a rough estimate of risk.\n\nIt is important to realize, she adds, that \u201cas the risk increases, the benefits tend to be greater. This is an evolving field, and our goal is to better discern who is at high and low risk of breast cancer and develop a greater range of prevention strategies.\u201d\n\nAn individual risk analysis should prompt conversation between doctor and patient about the potential benefits and the risk of the therapy.\n\nBoth the ASCO and the task force guidelines recommend such a conversation. \u201cThe discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent,\u201d according to ASCO.\n\nThe task force similarly recommends that \u201cclinicians engage in a shared, informed decision making\u201d with women and said that clinicians \u201cshould offer to prescribe\u201d these drugs. Many risk factors increase a woman\u2019s chances of having side effects. These factors include older age, obesity, having a history of a blood clot, history of any cancer, immobility, history of certain autoimmune conditions, history of using estrogen or oral contraceptives and history of some form of heart disease.\n\nInsured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.\n\nSo what should a woman do?\n\nMost important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes \u2014 including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not overconsuming alcohol \u2014 are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.\n\nVisvanathan and her colleagues are hopeful that more women will be aware of this option.\n\n\u201cA discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should begin to implement preventive strategies based on what we already know.\u201d\n\nMishori is an associate professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and director of the Health & Media fellowship.

men diagnosed with prostate cancer, uncertainty about what to do remains a big problem, despite years of research on the options.\n\nNow, a Swedish study suggests that radical prostatectomy \u2014 complete removal of the prostate gland \u2014 is better than \"watchful waiting\" for the treatment of younger men with low-risk prostate cancer.\n\nOn the surface, this seems to contradict a U.S. trend toward holding off on surgery and monitoring men who have low-risk cancers with what's called \"active surveillance.\"\n\nBut don't leap to any conclusions. Like every new study of prostate cancer, the results need to be carefully parsed.\n\nFirst, the study results, which appear in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. It's actually an update of a 2008 report, with an additional three years of data on the nearly 700 men who volunteered for the trial up to 15 years ago. All of them had early-stage prostate cancer at the beginning.\n\nThe study found 38 percent fewer prostate cancer deaths among men randomly assigned to the surgery group versus those in what the Swedes called the watchful-waiting group. Men who had surgery had 41 percent lower risk of their cancer spreading throughout the body, and 66 percent less risk of growth within the prostate.\n\nThe survival benefits were restricted to men under 65. For this group, surgery saved one life for every seven men who had prostatectomies \u2014 considered a favorable ratio. And it applied to men with tumors considered low-risk, meaning they have a relatively low Gleason score, a marker of tumor aggressiveness.\n\n\"Our findings show that some tumors that are considered to be low-risk at diagnosis do pose a threat to life, especially if they are not surgically removed,\" the study authors write.\n\nSo is this a slam-dunk for radical prostatectomy? Game over?\n\nFar from it. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Hospital makes some important points.\n\nFirst, only about 1 in 20 men in the Swedish study had a prostate cancer diagnosis based on a high PSA level. Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. But in the U.S., most prostate cancers are identified by PSA screening, and less than half have palpable tumors.\n\nThis is important, because experts believe many prostate tumors found by PSA are likely to be slow-growing \u2014 perhaps so slow they will never cause a problem before the man dies of something else.\n\nSo \"low risk\" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current \"low risk\" men diagnosed in the United States. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk.\n\nSecond, the Swedish study compared radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting. And Smith points out that \"watchful waiting\" does not mean the same thing as \"active surveillance.\"\n\n\"Watchful waiting means we're not going to treat you now and if you progress clinically, we'll treat you with hormone therapy \u2013 not with curative intent,\" Smith tells Shots.\n\n\"Active surveillance means observing the patient in a proactive way, with regularly scheduled biopsies,\" he adds. If there's a sign the cancer is progressing, doctors currently would treat with intent to cure, using surgery, radiation or both.\n\nSmith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there's reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the \"watchful waiting\" group in the newly published study.\n\nUnfortunately, there haven't been any large studies in which prostatectomy and radiation therapy have been compared in patients with early-stage prostate cancer who have been randomly assigned to one or the other.\n\nTwo such studies are underway.

But Smith warns against assuming those results will settle the question of how men with early-stage prostate cancer should be treated.\n\n\"There will always be questions, and an ongoing need to individualize therapy,\" he says.", "question": "Does the story seem to grasp the quality of the evidence?
